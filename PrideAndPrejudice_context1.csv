To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.," In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet's visit, and sat about ten minutes with him in his library."
"Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes, to press his friend to join it."," ""I certainly shall not."

"that he had sprained his ancle in the first dance!""", Here she was interrupted again.
"She was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.",    CHAPTER IV.
"When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been cautious in her praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her sister how very much she admired him."," ""He is also handsome,"" replied Elizabeth, ""which a young man ought likewise to be, if he possibly can."
"""He is just what a young man ought to be,"" said she, ""sensible, good humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!--so much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"""," ""I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time."

"Their manners are not equal to his."""," Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself, she was very little disposed to approve them."
That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.," ""Yes;--but he seemed to like his second better."""

"I would keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day."""," The boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she would, and the argument ended only with the visit."
She mentioned this to her friend Miss Lucas.," ""But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow."

"This is not quite enough to make her understand his character."""," ""Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded."""
"Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four evenings may do a great deal."""," ""Well,"" said Charlotte, ""I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a chance of happiness, as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth."

Lydia declared herself satisfied."," Mrs. Bennet and her daughters then departed, and Elizabeth returned instantly to Jane, leaving her own and her relations' behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of _her_, in spite of all Miss Bingley's witticisms on _fine eyes_."
"The perpetual commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each.", He made no answer.

"He addressed himself directly to Miss Bennet, with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her a slight bow, and said he was",but diffuseness and warmth remained for Bingley's salutation.
"At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said,", No one made any reply.

"Lydia gaped as he opened the volume, and before he had, with very monotonous solemnity, read three pages, she interrupted him with,"," Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,  ""I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit."
"Lydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,"," Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon."
"The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter of an hour's t?te-?-t?te with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on.--", Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.
"When the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her in return, by sitting down to whist.","Mrs. Philips was very thankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason."
"He inquired how far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in an hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there."," ""Yes,"" replied Wickham;--""his estate there is a noble one."
"""About a month,"" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject drop, added, ""He is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I understand.""", Elizabeth could not but look surprised.
Elizabeth could not but look surprised.," ""As much as I ever wish to be,"" cried Elizabeth warmly,--""I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable."""

"""As much as I ever wish to be,"" cried Elizabeth warmly,--""I have spent four days in the same house with him, and I think him very disagreeable."""," ""Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield."
"But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish--and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.--Here you are in your own family."""," ""I cannot pretend to be sorry,"" said Wickham, after a short interruption, ""that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen."
"You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one."""," ""I should take him, even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man."""
"The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen.""",Wickham only shook his head.
Wickham only shook his head.," ""I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his going away when I was at Netherfield."
"""I wonder,"" said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, ""whether he is likely to be in this country much longer."""," ""Oh!"
"I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will not be affected by his being in the neighbourhood."""," Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with all her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented farther inquiry."
"Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen, and speaking of the latter especially, with gentle but very intelligible gallantry."," ""Indeed!"""
"The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I was brought up for the church, and I should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now."""," ""Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift."
"""Indeed!"""," ""Good heavens!"""
"He meant to provide for me amply, and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given elsewhere."""," ""There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law."
"cried Elizabeth; ""but how could _that_ be?--How could his will be disregarded?--Why did not you seek legal redress?"""," ""This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced."""
"But the fact is, that we are very different sort of men, and that he hates me."""," ""Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_."
"""This is quite shocking!--He deserves to be publicly disgraced."""," Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them."
"Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than ever as he expressed them."," ""A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy."
"""But what,"" said she, after a pause, ""can have been his motive?--what can have induced him to behave so cruelly?"""," ""I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as this!"""
"He had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort of preference which was often given me."""," After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued, ""I _do_ remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper."
"After a few minutes reflection, however, she continued,"," ""I will not trust myself on the subject,"" replied Wickham, ""_I_ can hardly be just to him."""
"His disposition must be dreadful."""," Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, ""To treat in such a manner, the god-son, the friend, the favourite of his father!"""
"Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,","""We were born in the same parish, within the same park, the greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care."
"--She could have added, ""A young man too, like _you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiable""--but she contented herself with ""And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest manner!"""," ""How strange!"""
"Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendance, and when immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_, as of affection to myself."""," ""It _is_ wonderful,""--replied Wickham,--""for almost all his actions may be traced to pride;--and pride has often been his best friend."
"""How abominable!--I wonder that the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you!--If from no better motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for dishonesty I must call it."""," ""Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"""
"But we are none of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me, there were stronger impulses even than pride."""," ""Yes."
"""Can such abominable pride as his, have ever done him good?"""," ""What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?"""
"He has also _brotherly_ pride, which with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers."""," He shook his head.--""I wish I could call her amiable."
He shook his head.--," After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,  ""I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley!"
"After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying,"," ""Not at all."""

"He cannot know what Mr. Darcy is."""," The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin Elizabeth and Mrs."
"It had not been very great; he had lost every point; but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance, that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not make herself uneasy."," Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh."
"Mr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation were very intimately acquainted with the family of de Bourgh."," ""You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr."
"I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her notice, but he certainly has not known her long."""," ""No, indeed, I did not.--I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's connections."
"Darcy."""," ""Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates."""
"I never heard of her existence till the day before yesterday."""," This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss Bingley."
"Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already self-destined to another."," ""I believe her to be both in a great degree,"" replied Wickham; ""I have not seen her for many years, but I very well remember that I never liked her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent."
"""Mr. Collins,"" said she, ""speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her daughter; but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him, and that in spite of her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman."""," Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards; and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr. Wickham's attentions."
"Jane listened with astonishment and concern;--she knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr. Bingley's regard; and yet, it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as Wickham.--The possibility of his having really endured such unkindness, was enough to interest all her tender feelings; and nothing therefore remained to be done, but to think well of them both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account of accident or mistake, whatever could not be otherwise explained."," ""Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody."""
"It is, in short, impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side."""," ""Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion."
"""Very true, indeed;--and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?--Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody."""," ""I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.--If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it."
"no."""," ""It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--One does not know what to think."""
"Besides, there was truth in his looks."""," ""I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think."""
"""It is difficult indeed--it is distressing.--One does not know what to think."""," But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr. Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when the affair became public."
And even Mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it.," Elizabeth's spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley's invitation, and if he did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening's amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop, or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance."

"But in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy's pleasure in the Bingleys' invitation to the officers; and though this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant smile,"," This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by Elizabeth, and as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for Wickham's absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.--Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham."
"He walked away again immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to console her."," ""Heaven forbid!--_That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!--To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate!--Do not wish me such an evil."""
"""I dare say you will find him very agreeable."""," When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for Wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man of ten times his consequence."
After a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with," He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said."
"He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said."," ""Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"""
"""Very well.--That reply will do for the present.--Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones.--But _now_ we may be silent."""," ""Sometimes."
"""Do you talk by rule then, while you are dancing?"""," ""Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"""
"It would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together, and yet for the advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible."""," ""Both,"" replied Elizabeth archly; ""for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."""
"""Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"""," ""This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,"" said he."
"""Both,"" replied Elizabeth archly; ""for I have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds.--We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb."""," ""I must not decide on my own performance."""
"""How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say.--_You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."""," He made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to Meryton."
"She answered in the affirmative, and, unable to resist the temptation, added,", The effect was immediate.
"At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,"," ""He has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,"" replied Elizabeth with emphasis, ""and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life."""
"At length Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said,  ""Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his _making_ friends--whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is less certain."""," Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject."
"At that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy he stopt with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner."," The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir William's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together."
"Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,"," ""I do not think we were speaking at all."
"Recovering himself, however, shortly, he turned to his partner, and said,  ""Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking of."""," ""What think you of books?"""
"Sir William could not have interrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for themselves.--We have tried two or three subjects already without success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.""","said he, smiling."
"said he, smiling."," ""I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions."""
"no.--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same feelings."""," ""No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else."""
"""I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be no want of subject.--We may compare our different opinions."""," ""The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?"""
"""No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of something else.""","said he, with a look of doubt."

"""Yes, always,"" she replied, without knowing what she said, for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming,"," ""I am,"" said he, with a firm voice."

"""I am trying to make it out.""", She shook her head.
She shook her head.," ""I can readily believe,"" answered he gravely, ""that report may vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either."""
"I hear such different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."""," ""But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity."""

"""But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another opportunity.""",he coldly replied.
"They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and with an expression of civil disdain thus accosted her,"," ""His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,"" said Elizabeth angrily; ""for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself."""
"I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite's guilt; but really considering his descent, one could not expect much better."""," ""I beg your pardon,"" replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer."
"""His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same,"" said Elizabeth angrily; ""for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy's steward, and of _that_, I can assure you, he informed me himself."""," ""Insolent girl!"""
"""Excuse my interference.--It was kindly meant.""","She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make inquiries on the same subject of Bingley."
"Jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.--Elizabeth instantly read her feelings, and at that moment solicitude for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and every thing else gave way before the hope of Jane's being in the fairest way for happiness."," ""No,"" replied Jane, ""I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing satisfactory to tell you."
"But perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon."""," ""Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?"""
"I am afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy's regard."""," ""No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."""
"""Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?"""," ""This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy."
"""No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton."""," ""He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only."""
"But what does he say of the living?"""," ""I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley's sincerity,"" said Elizabeth warmly; ""but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only."
"""He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to him _conditionally_ only."""," She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on which there could be no difference of sentiment."
"On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery."," ""You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr."
"My total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology."""," ""Indeed I am."
"Darcy?"""," Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the acquaintance.--Mr."
"Collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased speaking, replied thus,","And with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident."
Mr. Collins then returned to Elizabeth.," As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley, and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to, made her perhaps almost as happy as Jane."
Her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.," ""For heaven's sake, madam, speak lower.--What advantage can it be to you to offend Mr."
"I am sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say nothing _he_ may not like to hear."""," Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence."
"He took the hint, and when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,"," Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to."
"Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and Elizabeth sorry for her, and sorry for her father's speech, was afraid her anxiety had done no good.--Others of the party were now applied to.","And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.--Many stared.--Many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr. Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to Lady Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man."
Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of,accompanied by a violent yawn.
"On finding Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,"," Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet instantly answered,  ""Oh dear!--Yes--certainly.--I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure she can have no objection.--Come, Kitty, I want you up stairs."""
"Before Elizabeth had time for any thing but a blush of surprise, Mrs. Bennet instantly answered,","And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out,  ""Dear Ma'am, do not go.--I beg you will not go.--Mr."
"And gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth called out,"," ""No, no, nonsense, Lizzy.--I desire you will stay where you are."""
"I am going away myself."""," Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction--and a moment's consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion."
"Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as soon as they were gone Mr. Collins began."," The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued:  ""My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example of matrimony in his parish."
"The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and he continued:",It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.
It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.," ""I am not now to learn,"" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the hand, ""that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time."
"I am very sensible of the honour of your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline them."""," ""Upon my word, Sir,"" cried Elizabeth, ""your hope is rather an extraordinary one after my declaration."
"I am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long."""," ""Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,"" said Mr. Collins very gravely--""but I cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you."
"I am perfectly serious in my refusal.--You could not make _me_ happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who would make _you_ so.--Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation."""," ""Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary."
"And you may be certain that when I have the honour of seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty, economy, and other amiable qualifications.""","And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her,  ""When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character."""
"And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her,"," ""Really, Mr. Collins,"" cried Elizabeth with some warmth, ""you puzzle me exceedingly."
"And rising as she thus spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus addressed her,  ""When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on this subject I shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application, and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character."""," ""You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course."
"If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as may convince you of its being one."""," ""I do assure you, Sir, that I have no pretension whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man."
"As I must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I shall chuse to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females."""," ""You are uniformly charming!"""
"Do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart."""," To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female."
"This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet;--she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe it, and could not help saying so."," ""Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam,"" cried Mr. Collins; ""but if she is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state."
"She is a very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but I will _make_ her know it."""," ""Sir, you quite misunderstand me,"" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed."

"Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning; but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed."," ""My dear,"" replied her husband, ""I have two small favours to request."
"You promised me to _insist_ upon her marrying him."""," Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did Mrs. Bennet give up the point."
"She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to her, cried in a half whisper,"," Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family."
"Charlotte had hardly time to answer, before they were joined by Kitty, who came to tell the same news, and no sooner had they entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family.", Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.
Charlotte's reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.," Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any attempt to reason with or sooth her would only increase the irritation."
"She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,"," Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear."
In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected conversation.--,"-  ""My dear Madam,"" replied he, ""let us be for ever silent on this point."
--,"he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure, ""to resent the behaviour of your daughter."
"Far be it from me,"" he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure,",    CHAPTER XXI.
"He joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunt's, where his regret and vexation, and the concern of every body was well talked over.--To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self imposed."," She highly approved his forbearance, and they had leisure for a full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk, he particularly attended to her."
"When they had gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,"," She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly, and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr. Hurst had a house."
"To these high flown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she saw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon cease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his."," ""Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into Hertfordshire this winter."
"Bingley will not be detained in London by them."""," ""When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which took him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when Charles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel."
"I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of whom we shall deprive you."""," ""It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_."""
"""It is evident by this,"" added Jane, ""that he comes back no more this winter."""," ""Why will you think so?"
"""It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.""","""Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her again."

"""Most willingly.""", Jane shook her head.
Jane shook her head.," ""If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,"" replied Jane, ""your representation of all this, might make me quite easy."
"But, my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend."""," ""That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you will not take comfort in mine."
"Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any one; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived herself."""," ""But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry elsewhere?"""
"You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer."""," ""You must decide for yourself,"" said Elizabeth, ""and if upon mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him."""

"""I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider your situation with much compassion.""", The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt.
Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her.,"Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time."
"As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again, whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them."," They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,  ""But is there not danger of Lady Catherine's disapprobation here, my good sir?--You had better neglect your relations, than run the risk of offending your patroness."""
"They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for so speedy a return, immediately said,"," ""My dear sir,"" replied Mr. Collins, ""I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."""

"""My dear sir,"" replied Mr. Collins, ""I am particularly obliged to you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so material a step without her ladyship's concurrence."""," ""Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this, as well as for every other mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire."
"Risk any thing rather than her displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.""", With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally surprised to find that he meditated a quick return.
"The possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but that Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from possibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,"," The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied,  ""Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion, because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?"""
"The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained her composure, and calmly replied,"," But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness."
"But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort for it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished her all imaginable happiness."," Elizabeth quietly answered ""Undoubtedly;""--and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family."
Elizabeth quietly answered,"-and after an awkward pause, they returned to the rest of the family."
"With many compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,"," Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy."
She complained bitterly of all this to her husband.," ""My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts."
"""Indeed, Mr. Bennet,"" said she, ""it is very hard to think that Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to make way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!"""," This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before,  ""I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate."
"This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and, therefore, instead of making any answer, she went on as before,"," ""What should not you mind?"""
"If it was not for the entail I should not mind it."""," ""I should not mind any thing at all."""
"""What should not you mind?"""," ""Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility."""
"""I should not mind any thing at all."""," ""I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for any thing about the entail."
"""Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such insensibility."""," ""I leave it to yourself to determine,"" said Mr. Bennet."
"How any one could have the conscience to entail away an estate from one's own daughters I cannot understand; and all for the sake of Mr. Collins too!--Why should _he_ have it more than anybody else?""",said Mr. Bennet.
"A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last on Mrs. Bennet's leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying,"," Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing."
"Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing."," With a stronger voice she soon added, ""I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself."""
"With a stronger voice she soon added,"," ""My dear Jane!"""
"With a stronger voice she soon added, ""I have this comfort immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it has done no harm to any one but myself."""," Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection."
"Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back the praise on her sister's warm affection."," ""My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these."
"in every view it is unaccountable!"""," ""To oblige you, I would try to believe almost any thing, but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her understanding, than I now do of her heart."
"Remember that she is one of a large family; that as to fortune, it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for every body's sake, that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin."""," ""I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,"" replied Jane, ""and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy together."
"You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of danger, security for happiness."""," ""And men take care that they should."""
"Women fancy admiration means more than it does."""," ""If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."""
"""And men take care that they should."""," ""I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design,"" said Elizabeth; ""but without scheming to do wrong, or to make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery."
"""If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine."""," ""And do you impute it to either of those?"""
"Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution, will do the business."""," ""Yes; to the last."
"""And do you impute it to either of those?"""," ""You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."""
"Stop me whilst you can."""," ""Yes, in conjunction with his friend."""
"""You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him."""," ""I cannot believe it."
"""Yes, in conjunction with his friend."""," ""Your first position is false."
"They can only wish his happiness, and if he is attached to me, no other woman can secure it."""," ""Beyond a doubt, they _do_ wish him to chuse Miss Darcy,"" replied Jane; ""but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing."
"They may wish many things besides his happiness; they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great connections, and pride.""", Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.
Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently.," ""Thank you, Sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me."
"He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."""," ""True,"" said Mr. Bennet, ""but it is a comfort to think that, whatever of that kind may befal you, you have an affectionate mother who will always make the most of it."""
"We must not all expect Jane's good fortune."""," Mr. Wickham's society was of material service in dispelling the gloom, which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the Longbourn family."
"Two of her girls had been on the point of marriage, and after all there was nothing in it."," Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth's correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation."
"When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject."," ""An excellent consolation in its way,"" said Elizabeth, ""but it will not do for _us_."
"A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when accident separates them, so easily forgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent."""," ""But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea."
"It does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl, whom he was violently in love with only a few days before."""," ""I never saw a more promising inclination."
"Pray, how _violent was_ Mr. Bingley's love?"""," ""Oh, yes!--of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt."
"Is not general incivility the very essence of love?"""," Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence."
"Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister's ready acquiescence."," ""And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a part of London!"
"We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her."""," ""So much the better."
"Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he would hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities, were he once to enter it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him."""," ""She will drop the acquaintance entirely."""
"_She_ will not be able to help calling."""," But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless."
"Mrs. Gardiner's caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone; after honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:"," ""My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."""
"You must not disappoint your father."""," ""Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."""
"""My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."""," ""Well, then, you need not be under any alarm."
"""Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."""," ""Elizabeth, you are not serious now."""
"He shall not be in love with me, if I can prevent it."""," ""I beg your pardon."
"""Elizabeth, you are not serious now."""," ""Perhaps it will be as well, if you discourage his coming here so very often."
"In short, I will do my best."""," ""As I did the other day,"" said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; ""very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_."
"At least, you should not _remind_ your Mother of inviting him."""," Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints, they parted; a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point, without being resented."
"His marriage was now fast approaching, and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say in an ill-natured tone that she","Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother's ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself, accompanied her out of the room."
"As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,"," ""_That_ you certainly shall."""
"As they went down stairs together, Charlotte said,  ""I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."""," ""And I have another favour to ask."
"""_That_ you certainly shall."""," ""We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."""
"Will you come and see me?"""," ""I am not likely to leave Kent for some time."
"""We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."""," Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit."
"Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the visit."," The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from the church door, and every body had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual."
"Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and complimented her on bearing it so well."," ""Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive?"
"I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."""," ""If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think."""
"Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is mercenary."""," ""She is a very good kind of girl, I believe."
"""If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know what to think."""," ""But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune."""
"I know no harm of her."""," ""No--why should he?"
"""But he paid her not the smallest attention, till her grandfather's death made her mistress of this fortune."""," ""But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event."""
"If it was not allowable for him to gain _my_ affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally poor?"""," ""A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant decorums which other people may observe."
"""But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her, so soon after this event."""," ""_Her_ not objecting, does not justify _him_."
"If _she_ does not object to it, why should _we_?"""," ""Well,"" cried Elizabeth, ""have it as you choose."
"It only shews her being deficient in something herself--sense or feeling."""," ""No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose."
"_He_ shall be mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish."""," ""Oh!"
"I should be sorry, you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire."""," ""Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment."""
"Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after all."""," Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer."
"Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer."," No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful."
"No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful.","    CHAPTER V.   Every object in the next day's journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state for enjoyment; for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health, and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight."
"It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining in, observed,"," ""Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,"" added Charlotte, ""and a most attentive neighbour."""
"I _should_ say, one of her ladyship's carriages, for she has several."""," ""Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say."
"""Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,"" added Charlotte, ""and a most attentive neighbour."""," The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and telling again what had been already written; and when it closed, Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding, and composure in bearing with her husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well."
"She opened the door, and met Maria in the landing place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out,"," Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the lane, in quest of this wonder; it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate."

"Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!"""," ""Oh!"
"Why does she not come in?"""," ""I like her appearance,"" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas."
"It is the greatest of favours when Miss De Bourgh comes in."""," Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that way."
"The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was such an instance of Lady Catherine's condescension as he knew not how to admire enough."," ""I am the less surprised at what has happened,"" replied Sir William, ""from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire."
"Who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an invitation moreover including the whole party) so immediately after your arrival!"""," Scarcely any thing was talked of the whole day or next morning, but their visit to Rosings."
"When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to Elizabeth,"," While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner.--Such formidable accounts of her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas, who had been little used to company, and she looked forward to her introduction at Rosings, with as much apprehension, as her father had done to his presentation at St. James's."
"She asked her at different times, how many sisters she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her mother's maiden name?--Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions, but answered them very composedly.--Lady Catherine then observed,"," ""A little."""
"For your sake,"" turning to Charlotte, ""I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line.--It was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh's family.--Do you play and sing, Miss Bennet?"""," ""Oh!"

"Charlotte had seen them from her husband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,"," Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room."
"She answered him in the usual way, and after a moment's pause, added,", She was perfectly sensible that he never had; but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the Bingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.
"_His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not scruple to call out,"," ""We are speaking of music, Madam,"" said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply."
"Let me hear what it is.""","said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply."
"""We are speaking of music, Madam,"" said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.", Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.
Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.," ""I assure you, Madam,"" he replied, ""that she does not need such advice."
"""I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,"" said Lady Catherine; ""and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal."""," ""So much the better."
"She practises very constantly."""," Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill breeding, and made no answer."
"Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said,"," ""I shall not say that you are mistaken,"" he replied, ""because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own."""
"My courage always rises with every attempt to intimidate me."""," Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, ""Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say."
"Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam,"," ""I am not afraid of you,"" said he, smilingly."
"Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such things may come out, as will shock your relations to hear.""","said he, smilingly."
"""I am not afraid of you,"" said he, smilingly."," ""You shall hear then--but prepare yourself for something very dreadful."
"""I should like to know how he behaves among strangers."""," ""I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party."""
"Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the fact."""," ""True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball room."
"""I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly beyond my own party."""," ""Perhaps,"" said Darcy, ""I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."""
"My fingers wait your orders."""," ""Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?"""
"""Perhaps,"" said Darcy, ""I should have judged better, had I sought an introduction, but I am ill qualified to recommend myself to strangers."""," ""I can answer your question,"" said Fitzwilliam, ""without applying to him."
"""Shall we ask him why a man of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"""," ""I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,"" said Darcy, ""of conversing easily with those I have never seen before."
"It is because he will not give himself the trouble."""," ""My fingers,"" said Elizabeth, ""do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which I see so many women's do."
"I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their concerns, as I often see done."""," Darcy smiled and said, ""You are perfectly right."
"Darcy smiled and said,"," Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know what they were talking of."
"Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said to Darcy,"," Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin's praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss De Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation."
"It was absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in this emergence recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure, she observed,"," ""Perfectly so--I thank you."""
"He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London."""," She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short pause, added,  ""I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?"""
"She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short pause, added,"," ""I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in future."
"She found that she was to receive no other answer--and, after a short pause, added,  ""I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever returning to Netherfield again?"""," ""If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we might possibly get a settled family there."
"He has many friends, and he is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing."""," ""I should not be surprised,"" said Darcy, ""if he were to give it up, as soon as any eligible purchase offers."""
"But perhaps Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same principle.""", Elizabeth made no answer.
"He took the hint, and soon began with,"," ""I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object."""
"Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford."""," ""Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."""
"""I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful object."""," ""Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made him happy if they had."
"""Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife."""," ""It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends."""
"She seems perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her."""," ""An easy distance do you call it?"
"""It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a distance of her own family and friends."""," ""And what is fifty miles of good road?"
"It is nearly fifty miles."""," ""I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_ of the match,"" cried Elizabeth."
"Yes, I call it a _very_ easy distance."""," ""It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire."
"""I should never have said Mrs. Collins was settled _near_ her family."""," As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,  ""I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family."
"As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,"," Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, ""_You_ cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment."
"Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said,", Elizabeth looked surprised.
"The gentleman experienced some change of feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and, glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,"," A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte and her sister, just returned from their walk."
"Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to any body, went away."," But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely, even to Charlotte's wishes, to be the case; and after various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding any thing to do, which was the more probable from the time of year."
"Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,"," ""I have been making the tour of the Park,"" he replied, ""as I generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at the Parsonage."
"Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile, she said,  ""I did not know before that you ever walked this way."""," ""No, I should have turned in a moment."""
"Are you going much farther?"""," And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together."
"And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage together.",said she.
said she.," ""And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least great pleasure in the power of choice."
"He arranges the business just as he pleases."""," ""He likes to have his own way very well,"" replied Colonel Fitzwilliam."
"Darcy."""," ""In my opinion, the younger son of an Earl can know very little of either."
"A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and dependence."""," ""These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have experienced many hardships of that nature."
"When have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose, or procuring any thing you had a fancy for?"""," ""Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do."""
"Younger sons cannot marry where they like."""," ""Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money."""
"""Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often do."""," ""Is this,"" thought Elizabeth, ""meant for me?"""
"""Our habits of expence make us too dependant, and there are not many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to money.""","nd she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, ""And pray, what is the usual price of an Earl's younger son?"
"and she coloured at the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone,"," He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped."
"To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed, she soon afterwards said,"," ""No,"" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, ""that is an advantage which he must divide with me."
"But, perhaps his sister does as well for the present, and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he likes with her."""," ""Are you, indeed?"
"I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy."""," As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly, and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth."
"She directly replied,"," ""I know them a little."
"I think I have heard you say that you know them."""," ""Oh!"
"Their brother is a pleasant gentleman-like man--he is a great friend of Darcy's."""," ""Care of him!--Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in those points where he most wants care."
"yes,"" said Elizabeth drily--""Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him."""," ""What is it you mean?"""
"It was all conjecture."""," ""It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing."""
"""What is it you mean?"""," ""You may depend upon my not mentioning it."""
"""It is a circumstance which Darcy of course would not wish to be generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family, it would be an unpleasant thing."""," ""And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be Bingley."
"""You may depend upon my not mentioning it."""," ""Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"""
"What he told me was merely this; that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer."""," ""I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady."""
"""Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?"""," ""And what arts did he use to separate them?"""
"""I understood that there were some very strong objections against the lady."""," ""He did not talk to me of his own arts,"" said Fitzwilliam smiling."
"""And what arts did he use to separate them?"""," Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with indignation."
"After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful."," ""You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"""
"Why was he to be the judge?"""," ""I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friend's inclination, or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy."""
"""You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?"""," ""That is not an unnatural surmise,"" said Fitzwilliam, ""but it is lessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly."""
"It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case."""," This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and, therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent matters till they reached the parsonage."
"He had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted.","were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London."
"""There were some very strong objections against the lady,"" were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words, and these strong objections probably were, her having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in business in London.","hen she thought of her mother indeed, her confidence gave way a little, but she would not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friend's connections, than from their want of sense; and she was quite decided at last, that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister."
"After a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner, and thus began,", Elizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression.
"Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and when he ceased, the colour rose into her cheeks, and she said,"," Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantle-piece with his eyes fixed on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise."
"At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,"," ""I might as well enquire,"" replied she, ""why with so evident a design of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?"
"But it is of small importance."""," As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued."
"As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she continued."," She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse."
He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.,she repeated.
"With assumed tranquillity he then replied,"," Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her."
"Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her."," ""You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,"" said Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour."
"or under what misrepresentation, can you here impose upon others?""","said Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour."
"""You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,"" said Darcy in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour."," ""His misfortunes!"""
"""Who that knows what his misfortunes have been, can help feeling an interest in him?"""," ""And of your infliction,"" cried Elizabeth with energy."
"repeated Darcy contemptuously; ""yes, his misfortunes have been great indeed."""," ""And this,"" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room, ""is your opinion of me!"
"and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with contempt and ridicule."""," Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,  ""You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner."""
"Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she said,"," She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,  ""You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way that would have tempted me to accept it."""
"She saw him start at this, but he said nothing, and she continued,", Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an expression of mingled incredulity and mortification.
She went on.," ""You have said quite enough, madam."
"""From the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that ground-work of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immoveable a dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry."""," And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him the next moment open the front door and quit the house."
"He had by that time reached it also, and holding out a letter, which she instinctively took, said with a look of haughty composure,","-And then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight."
"She wished to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming,","-and when she had gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing any thing of the last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not regard it, that she would never look in it again."
"She grew absolutely ashamed of herself.--Of neither Darcy nor Wickham could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial, prejudiced, absurd."," From herself to Jane--from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation _there_, had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again."
Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party.--," Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here, which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter."
"Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,"," ""I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,"" replied Elizabeth, ""but it is not in my power to accept it.--I must be in town next Saturday."""
"Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your company, I am sure."""," ""Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks."
"""I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,"" replied Elizabeth, ""but it is not in my power to accept it.--I must be in town next Saturday."""," ""But my father cannot.--He wrote last week to hurry my return."""
"Mrs. Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight."""," ""Oh!"
"""But my father cannot.--He wrote last week to hurry my return."""," ""You are all kindness, Madam; but I believe we must abide by our original plan."""
"And if you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the Barouche box, there will be very good room for one of you--and indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large.""", Lady Catherine seemed resigned.
Lady Catherine seemed resigned.," ""My uncle is to send a servant for us."""
"I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."""," ""Oh!--Your uncle!--He keeps a man-servant, does he?--I am very glad you have somebody who thinks of those things."
"""My uncle is to send a servant for us."""," Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey, and as she did not answer them all herself, attention was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a mind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was."
On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary., Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness.
"Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling solemnity replied,"," Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences."
"Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences."," Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts."
"He then handed her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings."," Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off."
"Elizabeth made no objection;--the door was then allowed to be shut, and the carriage drove off."," ""A great many indeed,"" said her companion with a sigh."
"cried Maria, after a few minutes silence, ""it seems but a day or two since we first came!--and yet how many things have happened!""",said her companion with a sigh.
"""A great many indeed,"" said her companion with a sigh."," Elizabeth privately added, ""And how much I shall have to conceal."""
"Elizabeth privately added,"," Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford, they reached Mr. Gardiner's house, where they were to remain a few days."
"is not this an agreeable surprise?"""," And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern, ""Oh!"
"And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect unconcern,"," ""Are they indeed?"""
"Besides, it will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight.""","cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction."
"cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction."," ""Yes,"" thought Elizabeth, ""_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed, and completely do for us at once."
"Only think what a miserable summer else we shall have!"""," ""Now I have got some news for you,"" said Lydia, as they sat down to table."
"Brighton, and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton."""," Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he need not stay."
"Lydia laughed, and said,"," ""And Mary King is safe!"""
"Wickham is safe."""," ""She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him."""
"added Elizabeth; ""safe from a connection imprudent as to fortune."""," ""But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,"" said Jane."
"""She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.""",said Jane.
"""But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,"" said Jane."," Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_ was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied liberal!"
"As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and Lydia's purchases, were seated in it."," With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes, did Lydia, assisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to Longbourn."
"Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth,"," Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news: and various were the subjects which occupied them; lady Lucas was enquiring of Maria across the table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other, retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to any body who would hear her."

"To this, Mary very gravely replied,", But of this answer Lydia heard not a word.
She was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.," ""Indeed,"" replied Elizabeth, ""I am heartily sorry for him; but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me."
"""His being so sure of succeeding, was wrong,"" said she; ""and certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his disappointment."""," ""Blame you!"
"You do not blame me, however, for refusing him?"""," ""But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham."""
"Oh, no."""," ""No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."""
"""But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham."""," ""But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very next day."""
"""No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."""," She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham."
"Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear one, without involving the other."," It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane."
"It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane."," ""Oh!"
"I am sure you must feel it so."""," ""Poor Wickham; there is such an expression of goodness in his countenance!"
"Your profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as light as a feather."""," ""There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those two young men."
"such an openness and gentleness in his manner."""," ""I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do."""
"One has got all the goodness, and the other all the appearance of it."""," ""And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him, without any reason."
"""I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you used to do."""," ""Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now."""

"""Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat the matter as you do now."""," ""How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved."""
"how I wanted you!"""," ""Certainly."
"""How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly undeserved."""," Miss Bennet paused a little and then replied, ""Surely there can be no occasion for exposing him so dreadfully."

"What is your own opinion?"""," ""You are quite right."
"At present I will say nothing about it.""", The tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation.
Here was knowledge in which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last incumbrance of mystery.," She was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the real state of her sister's spirits."
"Having never even fancied herself in love before, her regard had all the warmth of first attachment, and from her age and disposition, greater steadiness than first attachments often boast; and so fervently did she value his remembrance, and prefer him to every other man, that all her good sense, and all her attention to the feelings of her friends, were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets, which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity."," ""I do not believe that he will ever live at Netherfield any more."""

"He heard her attentively, and then said,  ""Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances."""," ""Already arisen!"""
"""If you were aware,"" said Elizabeth, ""of the very great disadvantage to us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia's unguarded and imprudent manner; nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the affair."""," ""Indeed you are mistaken."
"Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia's folly."""," Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,  ""Do not make yourself uneasy, my love."
"Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and affectionately taking her hand, said in reply,"," With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry."
"With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added,"," ""Nearly three weeks."""
"With an air of indifference he soon afterwards added, ""How long did you say that he was at Rosings?"""," ""And you saw him frequently?"""
"""Nearly three weeks."""," ""Yes, almost every day."""
"""And you saw him frequently?"""," ""His manners are very different from his cousin's."""
"""Yes, almost every day."""," ""Yes, very different."
"""His manners are very different from his cousin's."""," ""Indeed!"""
"But I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance."""," ""Oh, no!"""
"for I dare not hope,"" he continued in a lower and more serious tone, ""that he is improved in essentials."""," While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words, or to distrust their meaning."
"There was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention, while she added,"," Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents,  ""You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the _appearance_ of what is right."
"Wickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of accents,"," Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head."
"Her tour to the Lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts; it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours, which the discontentedness of her mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect."," When Lydia went away, she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and always very short."
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner., The period of expectation was now doubled.
"Mr. Gardiner declared his willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.", Elizabeth was distressed.
Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity., Elizabeth said no more--but her mind could not acquiesce.
"The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendor, and more real elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.", This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.
"At length, however, the question was asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied, that he was, adding,",How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day!
"The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who had been brought up by him at his own expence.--"," Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it."
"Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not return it."," ""I have heard much of your master's fine person,"" said Mrs. Gardiner, looking at the picture; ""it is a handsome face."
"It was drawn at the same time as the other--about eight years ago.""", Mrs. Reynolds's respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master.

"""And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, Ma'am?"""," ""I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him than this."
"""Yes, very handsome.""", This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.
"Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn when she was only eight years old.",said Mr. Gardiner.
said Mr. Gardiner.," Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks; Mrs. Reynolds, either from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister."

"""Not so much as I could wish, Sir; but I dare say he may spend half his time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months."""," ""If your master would marry, you might see more of him."""
"""Except,"" thought Elizabeth, ""when she goes to Ramsgate."""," ""Yes, Sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be."
"""If your master would marry, you might see more of him.""", Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled.
"Elizabeth could not help saying,"," ""I say no more than the truth, and what every body will say that knows him,"" replied the other."
"Elizabeth could not help saying, ""It is very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so."""," This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her ideas."
"Her keenest attention was awakened; she longed to hear more, and was grateful to her uncle for saying,"," ""Yes, Sir, I know I am."
"You are lucky in having such a master."""," Elizabeth almost stared at her.--""Can this be Mr."
Elizabeth almost stared at her.--,thought she.
thought she.,said Mrs. Gardiner.
"""His father was an excellent man,"" said Mrs. Gardiner."," Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more."
"Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase."," ""In what an amiable light does this place him!"""
"To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men.""",thought Elizabeth.
thought Elizabeth.," ""Perhaps we might be deceived."""
"""This fine account of him,"" whispered her aunt, as they walked, ""is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend."""," ""That is not very likely; our authority was too good."""
"""Perhaps we might be deceived."""," On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at Pemberley."
"On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shewn into a very pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done, to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when last at Pemberley.","said Elizabeth, as she walked towards one of the windows."
"Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter the room."," The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were all that remained to be shewn."
"With a glance she saw, that he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness, she began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not got beyond the words","when some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her, might be mischievously construed."
"This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and she could hardly suppress a smile, at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had revolted, in his offer to herself."," The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions."
"Her astonishment, however, was extreme; and continually was she repeating,"," After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration."
"She wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been very unexpected--",He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling.
He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling., The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it.
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to any thing they had expected.,said her uncle.
"""He is perfectly well behaved, polite, and unassuming,"" said her uncle."," ""I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us."
"I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it."""," ""To be sure, Lizzy,"" said her aunt, ""he is not so handsome as Wickham; or rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are perfectly good."
"His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling."""," Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning."
"Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could; said that she had liked him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning."," Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing."
"Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said nothing."," Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them to understand, in as guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire."
"He observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that it ""was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;"" and, before she could reply, he added,"," Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn."
"Miss Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,"," In Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress; but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone."
"When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister."," However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer."
"However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer."," Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the success she expected."
"He was resolutely silent however; and, from a determination of making him speak, she continued,"," ""Yes,"" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, ""but _that_ was only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance."""
"But afterwards she seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at one time."""," He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself."
"In such an exigence my uncle's advice and      assistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately      comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.""","cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared."
"Her pale face and impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's situation, hastily exclaimed,"," ""Good God!"
"I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I have not an instant to lose."""," Elizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them."
"On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her, or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,"," ""No, I thank you;"" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself."
"Is there nothing you could take, to give you present relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very ill."""," She burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could not speak another word."
"At length, she spoke again.", Darcy was fixed in astonishment.
Darcy was fixed in astonishment.," ""I am grieved, indeed,"" cried Darcy; ""grieved--shocked."
"But it is all, all too late now."""," ""Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland."""
"But is it certain, absolutely certain?"""," ""And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?"""
"""Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to Scotland."""," ""My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour."
"""And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?""", Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.
Darcy shook his head in silent acquiesence., Darcy made no answer.
"Lydia--the humiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,"," ""Oh, yes."
"This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day."""," He readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only one serious, parting, look, went away."
They were to be off as soon as possible.," ""Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement."
"""John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for us;--was it so?"""," ""That is all settled;"" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare."
"_That_ is all settled.""","repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare."
"""That is all settled;"" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to prepare.", But wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour.

"His temptation is not adequate to the risk.""","cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment."
"cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment."," ""Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest."
"Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe him capable of it?"""," ""In the first place,"" replied Mr. Gardiner, ""there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland."""
"Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the case?"""," ""Oh!"
"""In the first place,"" replied Mr. Gardiner, ""there is no absolute proof that they are not gone to Scotland."""," ""Well, then--supposing them to be in London."
"And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the Barnet road."""," ""But why all this secrecy?"
"It is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it might strike them that they could be more economically, though less expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland."""," ""But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"""
"Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would do as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in such a matter."""," ""It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,"" replied Elizabeth, with tears in her eyes, ""that a sister's sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt."
"""But can you think that Lydia is so lost to every thing but love of him, as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?"""," ""But you see that Jane,"" said her aunt, ""does not think so ill of Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."""

"""But you see that Jane,"" said her aunt, ""does not think so ill of Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt."""," ""And do you really know all this?"""

"He must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her."""," ""Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all."
"Can she be ignorant of what you and Jane seem so well to understand?"""," ""When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I suppose, to believe them fond of each other."""
"That such a consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts."""," ""Not the slightest."

"Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives."," ""Is my father in town?"""

"are quite well."""," Her sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of the whole party."
"Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage; blaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the errors of her daughter must be principally owing."," They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia."

"As for Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,"," Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added, ""Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful lesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false step involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex."""

"Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?"""," ""And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"""

"""I mean, that no man in his senses, would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as one hundred a-year during my life, and fifty after I am gone."""," ""No,"" said her father, ""Wickham's a fool, if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds."
"A small sum could not do all this."""," ""Ten thousand pounds!"
"I should be sorry to think so ill of him, in the very beginning of our relationship."""," Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought, continued silent till they reached the house."
"Their father then went to the library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room."," ""I comfort myself with thinking,"" replied Jane, ""that he certainly would not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her."
"Oh, Lydia!"""," ""If we are ever able to learn what Wickham's debts have been,"" said Elizabeth, ""and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his own."
"How could he spare half ten thousand pounds?"""," ""We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,"" said Jane: ""I hope and trust they will yet be happy."
"What a meeting for her, when she first sees my aunt!"""," ""Their conduct has been such,"" replied Elizabeth, ""as neither you, nor I, nor any body, can ever forget."
"Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten.""", It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened.
"He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied,"," ""May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"""
"He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly replied,  ""Just as you please."""," ""Take whatever you like, and get away."""
"""May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?"""," Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up stairs together."
"She was disturbed by no fear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct."," Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under."
"Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr. Gardiner's behaviour laid them all under."," ""Well,"" cried her mother, ""it is all very right; who should do it but her own uncle?"
"We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money."""," She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her father was at leisure to be consulted."
Other schemes too came into her head., Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy.
"She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter, and, without knowing or considering what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and importance."," Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption, while the servants remained."
"But when they had withdrawn, he said to her,"," A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror, that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter."
"Lydia's being settled in the North, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and besides, it was such a pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with every body, and had so many favourites."," His daughter's request, for such it might be considered, of being admitted into her family again, before she set off for the North, received at first an absolute negative."
"Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world.", Her father lifted up his eyes.
"Elizabeth looked expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,", Elizabeth could bear it no longer.
"She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to her eldest sister,"," It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment, from which she had been so wholly free at first."
"She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to hear herself called ""Mrs. Wickham,"" by each of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her ring and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids."," ""Very true; and if I had my will, we should."
"What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go."""," ""Oh, lord!"
"Must it be so?"""," ""I should like it beyond any thing!"""
"We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.""",said her mother.
said her mother.," ""I thank you for my share of the favour,"" said Elizabeth; ""but I do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."""
"""And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the winter is over.""", Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them.
"One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,"," ""No really,"" replied Elizabeth; ""I think there cannot be too little said on the subject."""
"Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"""," ""La!"
"""No really,"" replied Elizabeth; ""I think there cannot be too little said on the subject."""," ""Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them."
"I longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat."""," ""Mr."
"However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.""","repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement."
"repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement."," ""If it was to be secret,"" said Jane, ""say not another word on the subject."
"It was to be such a secret!"""," ""Oh!"
"You may depend upon my seeking no further."""," ""Thank you,"" said Lydia, ""for if you did, I should certainly tell you all, and then Wickham would be angry."""
"certainly,"" said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; ""we will ask you no questions."""," On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her power, by running away."
"Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance."""," Jane's delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was glad of it;--till it appeared whether her inquiries would receive any satisfaction, she had rather be without a confidante."

"Elizabeth hoped she had silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,"," ""Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,"" said Elizabeth."
"I wonder what he can be doing there."""," ""Undoubtedly."
"""It must be something particular, to take him there at this time of year."""," ""Yes; he introduced us to his sister."""

"""Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,"" (for Mrs. Philips first brought her the news.)"," ""You may depend on it,"" replied the other, ""for Mrs. Nicholls was in Meryton last night; I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certain true."
"And so, is it quite certain he is coming?"""," Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming, without changing colour."
"It was many months since she had mentioned his name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,", Elizabeth did not know what to make of it.
"Had she not seen him in Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come without it."," In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it."
"The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again."," ""No, no."
"""As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,"" said Mrs. Bennet, ""you will wait on him of course."""," His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to Netherfield."

"She enquired after his sister, but could do no more.",said Mrs. Bennet.
He readily agreed to it.,"Lately, George Wickham, Esq."
"to Miss Lydia Bennet,'"," Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations."
"How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could not tell."," Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery of shame, that she could hardly keep her seat."
"A few weeks, he believed."," Elizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious attention!"
"At that instant she felt, that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for moments of such painful confusion."," Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing how much the beauty of her sister re-kindled the admiration of her former lover."
"When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at Longbourn in a few days time."," Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of his concern, at having been prevented by business."

"""But the wife of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause to repine."""," ""Let us sit down."
"Is nothing due to me on that score?"""," ""_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_."""
"I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment."""," ""I will not be interrupted."
"""_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_."""," ""In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that sphere."
"If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere, in which you have been brought up."""," ""True."
"He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are equal."""," ""Whatever my connections may be,"" said Elizabeth, ""if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."""
"Do not imagine me ignorant of their condition."""," ""Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?"""
"""Whatever my connections may be,"" said Elizabeth, ""if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."""," Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation,  ""I am not."""
"Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady Catherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a moment's deliberation,", Lady Catherine seemed pleased.
Lady Catherine seemed pleased.," ""I will make no promise of the kind."""
"""And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?"""," ""Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished."
"""I will make no promise of the kind."""," ""And I certainly _never_ shall give it."
"I shall not go away, till you have given me the assurance I require."""," ""Not so hasty, if you please."
"I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject."""," ""You can _now_ have nothing farther to say,"" she resentfully answered."
"Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?""", And she rose as she spoke.
Her ladyship was highly incensed.," ""Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say."
"Do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?"""," ""You are then resolved to have him?"""
"You know my sentiments."""," ""I have said no such thing."
"""You are then resolved to have him?"""," ""It is well."
"I am only resolved to act in that manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me."""," ""Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,"" replied Elizabeth, ""have any possible claim on me, in the present instance."
"You are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world."""," ""And this is your real opinion!"
"And with regard to the resentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's concern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn."""," In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,  ""I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet."
"In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of the carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,"," Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself."
"Her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again and rest herself."," ""She is a very fine-looking woman!"
"""She did not choose it,"" said her daughter, ""she would go.""", Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.
Lady Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.,"        *       *       *       *       *  The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied it, with the same kind of supposition, which had appeased Mrs. Bennet's curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teazing on the subject."
"The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand."," She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her, was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held."
"He then said,"," The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued,  ""You look conscious."
"The colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt; and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her father continued,"," ""From Mr. Collins!"
"Collins."""," ""Something very much to the purpose of course."
"and what can _he_ have to say?""","aving thus offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another: of which we have been advertised by the same authority."
"Your daughter Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after her elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate, may be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious personages in this land.""""","""This young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive patronage."
"Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of."""," ""My motive for cautioning you, is as follows."
"We have reason to imagine that his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly eye."""," Elizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force one most reluctant smile."
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her.," ""Oh!"
"""Are you not diverted?"""," ""After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match."
"I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.""","""I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place, should be so generally known."
"You ought certainly to forgive them as a christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing.""","""Oh!"""
"For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?"""," ""Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing."
"But it is so strange!"""," To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his repeating it."
"Now was the moment for her resolution to be executed, and, while her courage was high, she immediately said,"," ""I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,"" replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise and emotion, ""that you have ever been informed of what may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness."
"Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express."""," ""You must not blame my aunt."
"I did not think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted."""," ""If you _will_ thank me,"" he replied, ""let it be for yourself alone."
"Let me thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering them.""", Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word.
"After a short pause, her companion added,"," Elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not very fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances."
"But, unluckily for her ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise."," Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, ""Yes, you know enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_."
"Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied,"," ""What did you say of me, that I did not deserve?"
"After abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations."""," ""We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening,"" said Elizabeth."
"I cannot think of it without abhorrence."""," ""I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself."
"""The conduct of neither, if strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved in civility.""",had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.'
"Your reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a more gentleman-like manner.'"," ""I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an impression."
"You know not, you can scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some time, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."""," ""I can easily believe it."
"I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such a way."""," ""Oh!"
"The turn of your countenance I shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible way, that would induce you to accept me.""", Darcy mentioned his letter.
Darcy mentioned his letter.," ""The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies."""
"I can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me."""," ""When I wrote that letter,"" replied Darcy, ""I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit."""
"""The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily changed as that implies."""," ""The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so."
"""When I wrote that letter,"" replied Darcy, ""I believed myself perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit."""," ""I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind."
"Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure."""," ""Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"""
"You shewed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."""," ""Indeed I had."
"""Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"""," ""My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you."
"I believed you to be wishing, expecting my addresses."""," ""Hate you!"
"How you must have hated me after _that_ evening?"""," ""I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at Pemberley."
"I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take a proper direction."""," ""No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."""
"You blamed me for coming?"""," ""Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you."
"""No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."""," ""My object _then_,"" replied Darcy, ""was to shew you, by every civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to."
"My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due."""," He then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend."
Darcy was delighted with their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of it.,said Elizabeth.
said Elizabeth.," ""That is to say, you had given your permission."
"When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.""","And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case."
"And though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much the case.", Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.
Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his friend.," ""From the former."
"""Did you speak from your own observation,"" said she, ""when you told him that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?"""," ""And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him."""
"I had narrowly observed her during the two visits which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection."""," ""It did."
"""And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to him.""", Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked herself.
CHAPTER XVII.,"was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and from all the others when they sat down to table."
"Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here."," ""This is a wretched beginning indeed!"
"I know it to be impossible.""", Jane looked at her doubtingly.
Jane looked at her doubtingly.," ""You know nothing of the matter."
"I know how much you dislike him.""", Miss Bennet still looked all amazement.
"Elizabeth again, and more seriously assured her of its truth."," ""There can be no doubt of that."
"forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be happy with him?"""," ""Very, very much."
"Shall you like to have such a brother?"""," ""Oh, yes!"
"Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"""," ""What do you mean?"""
"You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I tell you all."""," ""Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley."
"""What do you mean?"""," ""My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious."
"I am afraid you will be angry."""," ""It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began."
"Will you tell me how long you have loved him?"""," Another intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of attachment."
"When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing farther to wish.", Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy.
*       *       *       *       *, Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet.
"As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud,"," ""I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,"" said Mrs. Bennet, ""to walk to Oakham Mount this morning."
"As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information; and he soon afterwards said aloud, ""Mr. Bennet, have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?"""," ""It may do very well for the others,"" replied Mr. Bingley; ""but I am sure it will be too much for Kitty."
"It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has never seen the view.""", Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home.
"As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her, saying,"," During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be asked in the course of the evening."
"In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper,",She was gone directly.
"Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious."," How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable, her expressions more moderate!"
"It would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of her attachment to Mr. Darcy."," ""Have you any other objection,"" said Elizabeth, ""than your belief of my indifference?"""
"But will they make you happy?"""," ""None at all."
"""Have you any other objection,"" said Elizabeth, ""than your belief of my indifference?"""," ""I do, I do like him,"" she replied, with tears in her eyes, ""I love him."
"We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him."""," ""Lizzy,"" said her father, ""I have given him my consent."
"You do not know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms."""," Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many months suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match."

He heard her with astonishment.," He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, ""If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure."""
"He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading Mr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her at last to go--saying, as she quitted the room,"," Elizabeth's mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after half an hour's quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join the others with tolerable composure."
"She began at length to recover, to fidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself."," This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself, soon went away."
"But before she had been three minutes in her own room, her mother followed her."," This was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations' consent, there was still something to be wished for."
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem.,    CHAPTER XVIII.
"Elizabeth's spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr. Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her."," ""I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which laid the foundation."
"""I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first place?"""," ""My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not."
"I was in the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun."""," ""For the liveliness of your mind, I did."""
"Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?"""," ""You may as well call it impertinence at once."
"""For the liveliness of your mind, I did."""," ""Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?"""
"To be sure, you knew no actual good of me--but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love."""," ""Dearest Jane!"
"""Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was ill at Netherfield?"""," ""Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."""
"Why, especially, when you called, did you look as if you did not care about me?"""," ""But I was embarrassed."""
"""Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement."""," ""And so was I."""
"""But I was embarrassed."""," ""You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."""
"""And so was I."""," ""A man who had felt less, might."""
"""You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."""," ""How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it!"
"""A man who had felt less, might."""," ""You need not distress yourself."
"This will never do."""," ""Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use."
"My aunt's intelligence had given me hope, and I was determined at once to know every thing."""," ""My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I might ever hope to make you love me."
"or had you intended any more serious consequence?"""," ""Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to befall her?"""
"My avowed one, or what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were still partial to Bingley, and if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made."""," ""I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth."
"""Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine, what is to befall her?"""," ""And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did."
"But it ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it shall be done directly."""," From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner's long letter, but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find, that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:       ""I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have      done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of particulars; but      to say the truth, I was too cross to write."
