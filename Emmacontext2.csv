"Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he was by no means yet reconciled to his own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection, when he was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she had spent all the rest of her life at Hartfield.

He had received a good education, but, on succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied."
"Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction--her more than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity 'poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh, and saying,"," There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse. The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him, was all eat up."
"He loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his youth, but his conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his hospitality would have welcomed his visitors to every thing, his care for their health made him grieve that they would eat. Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things, to say:"," Emma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her intentions."
"But the Martins occupied her thoughts a good deal; she had spent two very happy months with them, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her visit, and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her talkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings, and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs. Martin's having"," For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate cause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings arose. She had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and daughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it appeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was always mentioned with approbation for his great good-nature in doing something or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs. Martin, no wife in the case; she did suspect danger to her poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she were not taken care of, she might be required to sink herself forever."
Not that she _wanted_ him to marry. She was in no hurry at all.," ""And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever seen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with her."""
"thought Emma. ""You know what you are about."""," ""Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business? He does not read?"""

He reads the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the window seats--but he reads all _them_ to himself."

"The next question was--  ""What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?"""," ""That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having any idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity."
"He is in Highbury every now and then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to Kingston. He has passed you very often."""," ""To be sure. Oh yes!"
"A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other.

"They seem very comfortable as they are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would probably repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it might be very desirable."""," ""Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune entirely to make--cannot be at all beforehand with the world."
"""Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!"""," ""To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably."
"Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune entirely to make--cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever money he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of the family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet."""," ""I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does marry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though his sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice.

"But they live very comfortably. They have no indoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year."""," ""Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any body can do."""
"The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates.

"Mr. Martin looked as if he did not know what manner was.

"I had no right to expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so very clownish, so totally without air.

You might not see one in a hundred with _gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley."
"I see the difference plain enough. But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!"""," ""Oh yes!--there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old man."
"Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent. You must see the difference."""," ""Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a person grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or awkwardness becomes."
"But Mr. Weston is almost an old man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty."""," ""There is no saying, indeed,"" replied Harriet rather solemnly. ""But there may be pretty good guessing."
"What is passable in youth is detestable in later age. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr. Weston's time of life?""","replied Harriet rather solemnly. ""But there may be pretty good guessing."
"Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr. Weston's time of life?"" ""There is no saying, indeed,"" replied Harriet rather solemnly."," ""Will he, indeed? That will be very bad."""
"""But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross, vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of nothing but profit and loss."""," ""How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended. He was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man."
"""Will he, indeed? That will be very bad."""," ""I wonder he did not remember the book""--was all Harriet's answer, and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time."

"He was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her, there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with:--but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin's riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton's admiration.

"But really, I could almost venture, if Harriet would sit to me. It would be such a delight to have her picture!"""," Yes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do with taking likenesses? You know nothing of drawing."
Don't pretend to be in raptures about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet's face.," ""Exactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--I have not a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it."
"""Well, if you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try what I can do.

She thinks so little of her own beauty."

How completely it meant, 'why should my picture be drawn?'"""," Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work directly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet."
They were both in ecstasies. A likeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital.," Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and was repeating, ""No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as you observe. Exactly so."
"But for Harriet's sake, or rather for my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_ _present_, I will break my resolution now."" Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and was repeating,","with so interesting a consciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the declaration must wait a little longer."
"There was no want of likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more height, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both--a standing memorial of the beauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton's very promising attachment was likely to add. Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought, entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again."," The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction, took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the picture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who saw it was pleased, but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every criticism."

It must be done directly; it must be done in London; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions, must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of December."

Emma could not think it too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh."
"A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then, about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and not very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be.

"They walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma time only to say farther,"," Harriet could just answer, ""Oh! dear, yes,"" before the gentleman joined them."
"If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to ourselves."" Harriet could just answer,","before the gentleman joined them. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the first subject on meeting."
His visit he would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back to accompany them.," Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she had not been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short, they would both be soon after her."
"Mr. Elton was speaking with animation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma, having sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw back a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged to join them. Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was only giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's party at his friend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and all the dessert."," They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into the house, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot, and fall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the lace off short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort."

The room they were taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door between them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her assistance in the most comfortable manner."
"But it would not do; he had not come to the point. He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told Harriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing serious."," Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her ingenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading them forward to the great event.

"The beginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.

Her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy."
"Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all.

""It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.--You quite forget poor Mr."
"Her wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy. I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied."""," ""It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.--You quite forget poor Mr. Weston."""

You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of the poor husband."
"""It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.--You quite forget poor Mr. Weston."""," ""Me, my love,"" cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.-- ""Are you talking about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for the misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is nothing he does not deserve. I believe he is one of the very best-tempered men that ever existed."
"I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for Isabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can."""," ""Where is the young man?"" said John Knightley."
"Excepting yourself and your brother, I do not know his equal for temper. I shall never forget his flying Henry's kite for him that very windy day last Easter--and ever since his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night, on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.--If any body can deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor."""," ""He has not been here yet,"" replied Emma. ""There was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately."""
"said John Knightley. ""Has he been here on this occasion--or has he not?"""," ""But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,"" said her father. ""He wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very proper, handsome letter it was."
"""He has not been here yet,"" replied Emma. ""There was a strong expectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in nothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately."""," ""My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes."""
"Whether it was his own idea you know, one cannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--"""," ""Three-and-twenty!--is he indeed?--Well, I could not have thought it--and he was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well, time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad."
"He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps--""  ""My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.""","My dear Madam,' but I forget how it went on; and it was signed 'F. C. Weston Churchill.'"
"However, it was an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept. 28th--and began, 'My dear Madam,'"," ""How very pleasing and proper of him!"" cried the good-hearted Mrs. John Knightley."
"C. Weston Churchill.' --I remember that perfectly."""," ""Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,"" observed Mr. John Knightley coolly. ""But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John."
"To give up one's child! I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else."""," Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and had half a mind to take it up; but she struggled, and let it pass. She would keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home to himself, whence resulted her brother's disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was important.--It had a high claim to forbearance."
"It did assist; for though he began with grave looks and short questions, he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way, and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends again; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and then a little sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring the baby,"," ""If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them, as you are where these children are concerned, we might always think alike."" ""To be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong."""
"Emma felt they were friends again; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and then a little sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring the baby,  ""What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces.

For her own sake she could not be rude; and for Harriet's, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she was even positively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's nonsense, which she particularly wished to listen to."

To her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her representation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of their having so many friends about them, revived him a little."
"His eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own. The horror of being blocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was full in her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was eager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them."," ""Indeed!"" replied he."
"I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my shoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold.""", Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs. Weston could only approve.
"To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account, who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending, Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus--"," ""I am ready, if the others are.""

Believe me, sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such professions."""," It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this--which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state of mind, he tried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed--  ""Charming Miss Woodhouse!"

"As to myself, I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings--Nothing could be farther from my wishes--your attachment to my friend Harriet--your pursuit of her, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were not your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you have never thought seriously of her?"""," ""Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend."
"I wish her extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object to--Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think, quite so much at a loss.

If there had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment."
"CHAPTER XVI   The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think and be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for!--Such a development of every thing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst of all. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken--more in error--more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself.", How she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he had never thought seriously of Harriet--never! She looked back as well as she could; but it was all confusion.
"It was adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought to be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. She was quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more."," She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a more serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might be, and must be. The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the awkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully."
"No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton's absenting himself. It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir out; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep entirely from them,--"," These days of confinement would have been, but for her private perplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited her brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable and obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body."
"She was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him away. She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the sight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making use of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself."," ""I do not know why you should say so.

It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof."""," ""I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who have always set him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural than one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish too."
"""How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature?"""," ""That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your own master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence."
"A man at his age--what is he?--three or four-and-twenty--cannot be without the means of doing as much as that. It is impossible."""," ""It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot want money--he cannot want leisure."
"You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage."""," ""Yes, sometimes he can."" ""And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure."""

"This proves that he can leave the Churchills."" ""Yes, sometimes he can."""," ""It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an intimate knowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior of a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be."
"""Yes, sometimes he can."" ""And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure."""," ""There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and resolution. It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay this attention to his father."
"We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs. Churchill's temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew can do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can at others."""," ""No,"" said Emma, laughing; ""but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to use!--Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible."
"I shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.' --If he would say so to her at once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no opposition made to his going."""," ""Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it. He would feel himself in the right; and the declaration--made, of course, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner--would do him more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the people he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do."
"But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for him!--Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as loud as he could!--How can you imagine such conduct practicable?"""," ""I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they have a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones."
"Respect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in this sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds would bend to his."""," ""Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal exertion, it could not be an equal conviction."""
"To him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have, without being so equal, under particular circumstances, to act up to it."""," ""Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life."""
"""Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal exertion, it could not be an equal conviction."""," ""Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of following his duty, instead of consulting expediency."
"""Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life."""," ""We shall never agree about him,"" cried Emma; ""but that is nothing extraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man: I feel sure that he is not."
"He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there would have been no difficulty now."""," ""Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it.

"Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly, though in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding, complying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man's perfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some advantages, it will secure him many others."""," ""Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else."""

"VOLUME II    CHAPTER I   Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma's opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. She could not think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required more; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned;--but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded, and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter, and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive--",she found something else must be done. They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.
"This she had been prepared for when she entered the house; but meant, having once talked him handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded by any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all the Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties. She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from her niece.","I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time for writing;' and when I immediately said, 'But indeed we have, we had a letter this very morning,' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized. 'Have you, upon your honour?'"
"Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can. And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, 'I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time for writing;'","ut indeed we have, we had a letter this very morning,' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized.

"Do let me hear what she says.'"" Emma's politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest--"," ""Thank you. You are so kind!"""
"I am extremely happy. I hope she is well?""","I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do--and so much fine work as you have done too!--I only wish my eyes may last me as well.'"" All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath; and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax's handwriting."

She was pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax's letter, and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention."

""Oh yes; next week."""
"However, she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at my mother's time of life--and it really is full two years, you know, since she was here. We never were so long without seeing her before, and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now."""," ""Oh yes; next week.""

"That is what she writes about. That is the reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in the common course, we should not have heard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday."""," ""So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not been for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so soon."
"""Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day."""," At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma's brain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the not going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther discovery,  ""You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time. Considering the very particular friendship between her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs."
"Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account of things."" At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma's brain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the not going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther discovery,"," ""Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have always been rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us, for months together--not able to come if any thing was to happen."
"Considering the very particular friendship between her and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell."""," ""But, in spite of all her friends' urgency, and her own wish of seeing Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates?"""
"--But ever since we had the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!"""," ""Yes--entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel and Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they should recommend; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native air, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately.""

"But Mrs. Dixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has no remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be compared with Miss Fairfax."""," ""Yes, that of course."" ""Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing!"
"There is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was absolutely plain--but extremely elegant and amiable."""," ""Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of November, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well since."
"Miss Campbell always was absolutely plain--but extremely elegant and amiable."" ""Yes, that of course."""," ""It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world."" ""And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following--as you will find from Jane's letter."
"so considerate!--But however, she is so far from well, that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an air that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her--and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she is unwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we should do."""," ""And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following--as you will find from Jane's letter. So sudden!--You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse, what a flurry it has thrown me in!"
"Nobody could nurse her, as we should do."" ""It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.""",Bless me! poor Jane is ill!'
"Jane desired me to do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I burst out, quite frightened, with 'Bless me! poor Jane is ill!"," ""I am afraid we must be running away,"" said Emma, glancing at Harriet, and beginning to rise--""My father will be expecting us. I had no intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes, when I first entered the house."
"He has a wife and family to maintain, and is not to be giving away his time. Well, now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her."""," And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded. She regained the street--happy in this, that though much had been forced on her against her will, though she had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax's letter, she had been able to escape the letter itself."
"These were charming feelings--but not lasting. Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, than saying to Mr. Knightley,","Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state. Former provocations reappeared."
"CHAPTER III   Emma could not forgive her;--but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he was expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with Mr. Woodhouse, his approbation of the whole; not so openly as he might have done had her father been out of the room, but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma. He had been used to think her unjust to Jane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement."," ""I am happy you approved,"" said Emma, smiling; ""but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield."" ""No, my dear,"" said her father instantly; ""_that_ I am sure you are not."
"You left nothing undone. I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument at her grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence."""," ""No, my dear,"" said her father instantly; ""_that_ I am sure you are not. There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are."
"I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument at her grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence."" ""I am happy you approved,"" said Emma, smiling; ""but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield."""," ""No,"" said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; ""you are not often deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension. I think you understand me, therefore."""
"If any thing, you are too attentive. The muffin last night--if it had been handed round once, I think it would have been enough."""," An arch look expressed--""I understand you well enough;"" but she said only, ""Miss Fairfax is reserved."" ""I always told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its foundation in diffidence."

"a great pity indeed! and I have often wished--but it is so little one can venture to do--small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon--Now we have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg; it is very small and delicate--Hartfield pork is not like any other pork--but still it is pork--and, my dear Emma, unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried, without the smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear roast pork--I think we had better send the leg--do not you think so, my dear?"""," ""That's right, my dear, very right.

You like news--and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you."""
"I had not thought of it before, but that is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome."""," ""News!

It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news, as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long; but she was sorry for Harriet: Harriet must feel it--and all that she could hope was, by giving the first information herself, to save her from hearing it abruptly from others."
"If she were to meet Miss Bates in her way!--and upon its beginning to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her at Mrs. Goddard's, and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her without preparation. The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes, when in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the","which instantly burst forth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation. As the blow was given, Emma felt that she could not now shew greater kindness than in listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she had to tell."
"""She had set out from Mrs. Goddard's half an hour ago--she had been afraid it would rain--she had been afraid it would pour down every moment--but she thought she might get to Hartfield first--she had hurried on as fast as possible; but then, as she was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her, she thought she would just step in and see how it went on; and though she did not seem to stay half a moment there, soon after she came out it began to rain, and she did not know what to do; so she ran on directly, as fast as she could, and took shelter at Ford's."" --Ford's was the principal woollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher's shop united; the shop first in size and fashion in the place.--""And so, there she had set, without an idea of any thing in the world, full ten minutes, perhaps--when, all of a sudden, who should come in--to be sure it was so very odd!--but they always dealt at Ford's--who should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and her brother!-", Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in her power. She was obliged to stop and think.
"They might all have hoped to rise by Harriet's acquaintance: and besides, what was the value of Harriet's description?--So easily pleased--so little discerning;--what signified her praise? She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of being dwelt on,"," Harriet said, ""very true,"" and she ""would not think about it;"" but still she talked of it--still she could talk of nothing else; and Emma, at last, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was obliged to hurry on the news, which she had meant to give with so much tender caution; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet--such a conclusion of Mr. Elton's importance with her! Mr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived."
"She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of being dwelt on,  ""It might be distressing, for the moment,"" said she; ""but you seem to have behaved extremely well; and it is over--and may never--can never, as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think about it.""

"The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary. It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that neither ""master nor mistress was at home;"" they had both been out some time; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.","And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both--such being the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind.

To know that _she_ thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy."
"The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment's thought, she hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more. Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command, as well as the route and the method of his journey; and she listened, and smiled, and congratulated.","said he, at the conclusion.

"But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.

They had been arrived only a few minutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his explanation of Frank's being a day before his time, and her father was yet in the midst of his very civil welcome and congratulations, when she appeared, to have her share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure."

She was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him alter his plan, and travel earlier, later, and quicker, that he might gain half a day."," ""It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,"" said the young man, ""though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far; but in coming _home_ I felt I might do any thing."" The word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency."
"I remembered what I used to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in upon one's friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs.""", The word _home_ made his father look on him with fresh complacency. Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable; the conviction was strengthened by what followed.
"He got as near as he could to thanking her for Miss Taylor's merits, without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse's character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And at last, as if resolved to qualify his opinion completely for travelling round to its object, he wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her person."," ""You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,""  said Emma; ""were you to guess her to be _eighteen_, I should listen with pleasure; but _she_ would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words. Don't let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman."""
"""Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,"" said he; ""but I confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston."""," ""I hope I should know better,"" he replied; ""no, depend upon it, (with a gallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms."" Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her mind, had ever crossed his; and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance."

That, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof."""," ""Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a very strong proof."" ""Certainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger than, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable to me."
"Dixon is very musical, is he? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you, than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year."""," ""Certainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger than, if _I_ had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable to me. I could not excuse a man's having more music than love--more ear than eye--a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings."
"We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you, than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year."" ""Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a very strong proof."""," ""It was her very particular friend, you know."" ""Poor comfort!"""
"I could not excuse a man's having more music than love--more ear than eye--a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings. How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?"""," ""Poor comfort!"" said Emma, laughing."
"How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?"" ""It was her very particular friend, you know."""," ""You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she really did not seem to feel it."""
"""One would rather have a stranger preferred than one's very particular friend--with a stranger it might not recur again--but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!--Poor Mrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she is gone to settle in Ireland."""," ""So much the better--or so much the worse:--I do not know which. But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her--quickness of friendship, or dulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have felt it: Miss Fairfax herself."
"""You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she really did not seem to feel it."""," ""As to that--I do not--""  ""Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's sensations from you, or from any body else."
"But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her--quickness of friendship, or dulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have felt it: Miss Fairfax herself. She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction."""," ""Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's sensations from you, or from any body else."
"She must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction."" ""As to that--I do not--"""," ""There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all--""  he began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, ""however, it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were--how it might all be behind the scenes. I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly."
"They are known to no human being, I guess, but herself. But if she continued to play whenever she was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses."""," ""I have known her from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children and women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever she visited her friends. But we never did."
"I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be a better judge of her character, and of how she is likely to conduct herself in critical situations, than I can be."""," ""It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,"" said he. ""Oftentimes very convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing."
"I hardly know how it has happened; a little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she always was, by her aunt and grandmother, and all their set. And then, her reserve--I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved."""," ""Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction may be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, or an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of conquering any body's reserve to procure one."
"There is safety in reserve, but no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person."""," He perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, and thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him, that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting. He was not exactly what she had expected; less of the man of the world in some of his notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore better than she had expected."
"Vanity, extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his father and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how his conduct might appear in general; he became liable to all these charges. His father only called him a coxcomb, and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it, was clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible, and making no other comment than that"," With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him. Mrs. Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself--how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether."
"He gave her to understand that Frank admired her extremely--thought her very beautiful and very charming; and with so much to be said for him altogether, she found she must not judge him harshly. As Mrs. Weston observed,"," There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so leniently disposed. In general he was judged, throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man--one who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles--Mr. Knightley."
"In general he was judged, throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man--one who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles--Mr. Knightley. The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment, he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand,","She had half a mind to resent; but an instant's observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass. Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and Mrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune."
"But she had made up her mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her very differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs. Weston's accounting for it with","was not quite sufficient. She felt that she should like to have had the power of refusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled there, consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her, occurred again and again, she did not know that she might not have been tempted to accept."
"The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her spirits; and her being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort. It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her first remark, on reading it, was that","she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do, that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful. She owned that, considering every thing, she was not absolutely without inclination for the party."
"As for _his_ going, Emma did not wish him to think it possible, the hours would be too late, and the party too numerous. He was soon pretty well resigned."," ""Well, sir,"" cried Mr. Weston, ""as I took Miss Taylor away, it is incumbent on me to supply her place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment, if you wish it."" But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing, not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation."
"Then turning to Mrs. Weston, with a look of gentle reproach--""Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not married, you would have staid at home with me."""," But the idea of any thing to be done in a _moment_, was increasing, not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation. The ladies knew better how to allay it."
"But first of all, there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole."""," ""But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?"" ""Oh!"
"You will not like staying late. You will get very tired when tea is over."""," ""Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired."
"You will get very tired when tea is over."" ""But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?"""," ""But, my dear sir,"" cried Mr. Weston, ""if Emma comes away early, it will be breaking up the party."" ""And no great harm if it does,"" said Mr. Woodhouse."
"There will be a great many people talking at once. You will not like the noise."""," ""And no great harm if it does,"" said Mr. Woodhouse. ""The sooner every party breaks up, the better."""
"You will not like the noise."" ""But, my dear sir,"" cried Mr. Weston, ""if Emma comes away early, it will be breaking up the party."""," ""But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma's going away directly after tea might be giving offence."
"""And no great harm if it does,"" said Mr. Woodhouse. ""The sooner every party breaks up, the better."""," ""No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to you for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain."
"They are good-natured people, and think little of their own claims; but still they must feel that any body's hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss Woodhouse's doing it would be more thought of than any other person's in the room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have been your neighbours these _ten_ years."""," ""Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account."
"You will not regard being tired. You will be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends."""," He did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that, if she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if hungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid should sit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house, as usual. CHAPTER VIII   Frank Churchill came back again; and if he kept his father's dinner waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious for his being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray any imperfection which could be concealed."
"He had no reason to wish his hair longer, to conceal any confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve his spirits. He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after seeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself:--"," With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again, and for a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners, and by inference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be, who were now seeing them together for the first time. She meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr. Cole's; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr. Elton, even in the days of his favour, none had disturbed her more than his propensity to dine with Mr. Cole."
"She followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was pleased to see that it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses, having little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, and independence, was too apt, in Emma's opinion, to get about as he could, and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey. She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart, for he stopped to hand her out."," He thanked her, observing, ""How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.--You might not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner."""
"""This is coming as you should do,"" said she; ""like a gentleman.--I am quite glad to see you."" He thanked her, observing,"," ""Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them."
"He thanked her, observing, ""How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.--You might not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner."""," ""Nonsensical girl!"" was his reply, but not at all in anger."
"You are not striving to look taller than any body else. _Now_ I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you.""","was his reply, but not at all in anger. Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with Mr. Knightley."
"That very dear part of Emma, her fancy, received an amusing supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte--a very elegant looking instrument--not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the substance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and explanations on Miss Bates's, was, that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood's the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece--entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates's account, Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it--but now, they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter;--of course it must be from Colonel Campbell."," Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell, and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and still listen to Mrs. Cole. ""I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, who plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument."
"They might chuse to surprize her."" Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell, and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and still listen to Mrs. Cole."," Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's, turned to Frank Churchill. ""Why do you smile?"""
"and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our little girls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of it; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.--I was saying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he quite agreed with me; only he is so particularly fond of music that he could not help indulging himself in the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought--or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening."" Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's, turned to Frank Churchill.","said she. ""Nay, why do you?"""
"""Why do you smile?"" said she."," ""Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell's being so rich and so liberal.--It is a handsome present."" ""Very."""
"said she. ""Nay, why do you?"""," ""Very."" ""I rather wonder that it was never made before."""

"""What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?"""," ""If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_. Dixon in them."""
"It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say. I told you that your suspicions would guide mine."""," ""Mr. Dixon.--Very well."
"""If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend _Mr_. Dixon in them."""," ""Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting either that, after making his proposals to her friend, he had the misfortune to fall in love with _her_, or that he became conscious of a little attachment on her side. One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland."
"Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the other day, you know, of his being so warm an admirer of her performance."""," ""And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr. Dixon's preference of her music to her friend's, I can answer for being very decided."""
"Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I dare say in her's. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions, though you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell you what they are."""," ""And then, he saved her life.

How would he bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him?--To have her haunting the Abbey, and thanking him all day long for his great kindness in marrying Jane?--'So very kind and obliging!--But he always had been such a very kind neighbour!'"
"In the way of love, I am sure he does not. He would do any good to her, or her family; but--""  ""Well,"" said Mrs. Weston, laughing, ""perhaps the greatest good he could do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home."""," ""For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her."
"And then fly off, through half a sentence, to her mother's old petticoat. 'Not that it was such a very old petticoat either--for still it would last a great while--and, indeed, she must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong.'"""," ""Then it can be no argument to prove that he is in love. But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him to do."
"I cannot help suspecting him. I think he is just the person to do it, even without being in love."""," ""I have heard him lamenting her having no instrument repeatedly; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common course of things, occur to him."" ""Very well; and if he had intended to give her one, he would have told her so."""

I see no sign of attachment--I believe nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax."""
"I have a very strong notion that it comes from him. I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner."""," They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was the most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;--and at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it. Frank Churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston, she had been seeing nothing, except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr. Cole, to add his very pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it suited Emma best to lead, she gave a very proper compliance."
"His admiration was certainly very warm; yet she thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have struck her. As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own."," ""Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,"" he replied;--""but you must often wish it, I am sure."" And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another step."
"""I often feel concern,"" said she, ""that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put-to for such a purpose.""","And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another step. ""This present from the Campbells,"" said she--""this pianoforte is very kindly given."""
"""Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,"" he replied;--""but you must often wish it, I am sure."" And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another step."," ""Yes,"" he replied, and without the smallest apparent embarrassment.--""But they would have done better had they given her notice of it. Surprizes are foolish things."
"And he smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she must proceed another step. ""This present from the Campbells,"" said she--""this pianoforte is very kindly given."""," From that moment, Emma could have taken her oath that Mr. Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there were no actual preference--remained a little longer doubtful."
"But whether he were entirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there were no actual preference--remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of Jane's second song, her voice grew thick."," Another song, however, was soon begged for. ""One more;--they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more."""
"""One more;--they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more."" And Frank Churchill was heard to say,"," Mr. Knightley grew angry. ""That fellow,"" said he, indignantly, ""thinks of nothing but shewing off his own voice."
"The strength of the song falls on the second."" Mr. Knightley grew angry.","And touching Miss Bates, who at that moment passed near--""Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere."
"This must not be."" And touching Miss Bates, who at that moment passed near--"," Miss Bates, in her real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to be grateful, before she stept forward and put an end to all farther singing. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing--originating nobody exactly knew where--was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space."
"It was growing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her mother's account. After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to begin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful, and have done.","   CHAPTER IX   Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity."
"She did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood--and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half. She was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's praise could have satisfied her, she might soon have been comforted."," ""Don't class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her's, than a lamp is like sunshine."""
"""Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!"""," ""Oh! dear--I think you play the best of the two."

"I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body last night said how well you played."""," ""Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she does, or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out.

"They were stopping, however, in the first place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught their eye.--Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and the agreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument."," ""And while Mrs. Weston pays her visit, I may be allowed, I hope,"" said Frank Churchill, ""to join your party and wait for her at Hartfield--if you are going home.""

"If she does wrong, she ought to feel it."" ""She is not entirely without it, I think."""," Shortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr. Knightley on horse-back not far off. ""Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him if possible, just to thank him."
"She is playing _Robin_ _Adair_ at this moment--_his_ favourite."" Shortly afterwards Miss Bates, passing near the window, descried Mr. Knightley on horse-back not far off."," She was in the adjoining chamber while she still spoke, and opening the casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention, and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others, as if it had passed within the same apartment.

"Quite delightful to have you all meet so!--Our little room so honoured!""

How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she caught no cold last night."
"You will find some friends here."" So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,", And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else. The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning.

You must have heard every thing to be sure. 'Can I do any thing for you at Kingston?'," Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates, before they set off for Randalls. CHAPTER XI   It may be possible to do without dancing entirely."
"His first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole's should be finished there--that the same party should be collected, and the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence. Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance; and the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly who there would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple.","had been repeated many times over. ""And there will be the two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley."
"Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance; and the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly who there would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple.

On another,  ""And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up."
"Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress about the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score of health. It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be persevered in.","speaking lower) is very thoughtless. Do not tell his father, but that young man is not quite the thing."
Pray do not let them talk of it. That young man (speaking lower)," Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She knew the importance of it, and said every thing in her power to do it away."
"She knew the importance of it, and said every thing in her power to do it away. Every door was now closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on Frank Churchill's part, that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten."," Emma demurred. ""It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in?"""
"Ten couple may stand here very well."" Emma demurred."," ""Very true,"" he gravely replied; ""it was very bad."" But still he went on measuring, and still he ended with,  ""I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple."""
"Emma demurred. ""It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in?""","But still he went on measuring, and still he ended with,  ""I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple."" ""No, no,"" said she, ""you are quite unreasonable."
"""Very true,"" he gravely replied; ""it was very bad."" But still he went on measuring, and still he ended with,"," ""No, no,"" said she, ""you are quite unreasonable. It would be dreadful to be standing so close!"
"""Very true,"" he gravely replied; ""it was very bad."" But still he went on measuring, and still he ended with,  ""I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple."""," ""There is no denying it,"" he replied. ""I agree with you exactly."
"It would be dreadful to be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!"""," Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest. Had she intended ever to _marry_ him, it might have been worth while to pause and consider, and try to understand the value of his preference, and the character of his temper; but for all the purposes of their acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough."
"Before the middle of the next day, he was at Hartfield; and he entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme. It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement."," ""The Crown!"" ""Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot, my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there."
"I bring a new proposal on the subject:--a thought of my father's, which waits only your approbation to be acted upon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the Crown Inn?"""," ""Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot, my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there. Better accommodations, he can promise them, and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls."
"May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the Crown Inn?"" ""The Crown!"""," ""It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs. Weston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for myself, shall be most happy--It seems the only improvement that could be."
"Ten couple, in either of the Randalls rooms, would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt how right you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing _any_ _thing_ to like to yield. Is not it a good exchange?--You consent--I hope you consent?"""," She was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully comprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable. ""No; he thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--much worse than the other."
"no--a very bad plan. They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere."""," ""Sir,"" said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, ""you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill."
"""I was going to observe, sir,"" said Frank Churchill, ""that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body's catching cold--so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but nobody else could."""," ""From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief."""
"Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father's house."""," ""Open the windows!--but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent!"

We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief."""," ""Ah! sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected."
"I never heard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!--I am sure, neither your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would suffer it."""," ""Have you indeed, sir?--Bless me! I never could have supposed it."
"sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I have often known it done myself."""," ""But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--""  ""Oh!"" interrupted Emma, ""there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over."
"One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what can be done."""," ""Oh!"" interrupted Emma, ""there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over."
"If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what can be done."" ""But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--"""," ""So they will, my dear. That is a great thing."
"If it can be contrived to be at the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. They will be so near their own stable."""," ""I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be under Mrs. Weston's care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole."""
"I doubt it. I do not know her, even by sight."""," ""There, papa!--Now you must be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston, who is carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so many years ago, when I had the measles?"
"""I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be under Mrs. Weston's care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole.""","If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.' How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!"""
"Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so many years ago, when I had the measles? 'If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.'"," ""Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so."
"'If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.' How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!"""," ""My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,"" said Frank Churchill, ""examining the capabilities of the house. I left them there and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot."
"He said, from the first, it was a very good sort--which was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint. I hope whenever poor Isabella's little ones have the measles, she will send for Perry."""," Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father, engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown. There were Mr. and Mrs. Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy and very happy in their different way; she, in some little distress; and he, finding every thing perfect."

"Look! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined."""," The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, ""Men never know when things are dirty or not;"" and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself, ""Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares."" One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain."
"A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again. She then took another line of expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,"," And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through the passage, was calling out,  ""You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It is a mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs."""
"We shall not be many, you know."" And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through the passage, was calling out,"," ""I wish,"" said Mrs. Weston, ""one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best. To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object--if one could but tell what that would be."""
"And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through the passage, was calling out,  ""You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear.

"""I wish,"" said Mrs. Weston, ""one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best. To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object--if one could but tell what that would be."""," ""Well--if you please,"" said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, ""if you think she will be of any use."" ""You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,"" said Emma."
"I think we do want a larger council. Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?"""," ""You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,"" said Emma. ""She will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing."
"Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?"" ""Well--if you please,"" said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, ""if you think she will be of any use."""," ""But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk."
"She will not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates."""," Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it his decided approbation. ""Aye, do, Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter at once."
"And I need not bring the whole family, you know."" Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it his decided approbation."," ""Both sir! Can the old lady?""..."
"But fetch them both. Invite them both.""","..  ""The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure."
"Can the old lady? ""..."," ""Oh! I beg your pardon, sir."
"No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you a great blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.""","And away he ran. Long before he reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt, and her elegant niece,--Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered woman and a good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils of it much less than she had supposed before--indeed very trifling; and here ended the difficulties of decision."
"Her approbation, at once general and minute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for another half-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different rooms, some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of the future. The party did not break up without Emma's being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor without her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife,","   CHAPTER XII   One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to Emma--its being fixed for a day within the granted term of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston's confidence, she could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight. But this was not judged feasible."
"Either because he did not dance himself, or because the plan had been formed without his being consulted, he seemed resolved that it should not interest him, determined against its exciting any present curiosity, or affording him any future amusement. To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply, than,"," This Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry. It was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent, or so indignant; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the ball, for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree."
"It was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he was so indifferent, or so indignant; he was not guided by _her_ feelings in reprobating the ball, for _she_ enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree.

"Do not forget your engagement."" Emma looked graciously."," ""As you do us such ample justice now,"" said Emma, laughing, ""I will venture to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first? Do not we rather surpass your expectations?"

Happy those, who can remain at Highbury!"""," He laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma was convinced that it had been so. ""And you must be off this very morning?"""

"How unlucky! Miss Bates's powerful, argumentative mind might have strengthened yours.""","-  He hesitated, got up, walked to a window. ""In short,"" said he, ""perhaps, Miss Woodhouse--I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion""--  He looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts."
"She is a woman that one may, that one _must_ laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to pay my visit, then""--  He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.","-  He looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts. She hardly knew what to say."
"It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious, which she did not wish. Forcing herself to speak, therefore, in the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,","-  He was silent. She believed he was looking at her; probably reflecting on what she had said, and trying to understand the manner."
"He could not believe her to be encouraging him. A few awkward moments passed, and he sat down again; and in a more determined manner said,","-  He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.--He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might have ended, if his father had not made his appearance? Mr. Woodhouse soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him composed."
"A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. Mr. Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that was doubtful, said,","and the young man, though he might and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.

Short had been the notice--short their meeting; he was gone; and Emma felt so sorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it too much."
"To complete every other recommendation, he had _almost_ told her that he loved her. What strength, or what constancy of affection he might be subject to, was another point; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all the rest, made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him, in spite of every previous determination against it."," Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He could not say that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with considerable kindness added,  ""You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really out of luck; you are very much out of luck!"""

She had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from headache to a degree, which made her aunt declare, that had the ball taken place, she did not think Jane could have attended it; and it was charity to impute some of her unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill-health."
"Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting; but still they were to part. When she became sensible of this, it struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father, never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings."," Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings. ""_He_ is undoubtedly very much in love--every thing denotes it--very much in love indeed!--and when he comes again, if his affection continue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up."
"I should be sorry to be more."" Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings."," When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had undervalued their strength. It was a long, well-written letter, giving the particulars of his journey and of his feelings, expressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision."
"His recollection of Harriet, and the words which clothed it, the ""beautiful little friend,"" suggested to her the idea of Harriet's succeeding her in his affections. Was it impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.--For Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed."," It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf, though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that quarter was at hand. As Frank Churchill's arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton's engagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank Churchill's disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were assuming the most irresistible form.--His wedding-day was named."
"Harriet listened submissively, and said ""it was very true--it was just as Miss Woodhouse described--it was not worth while to think about them--and she would not think about them any longer"" but no change of subject could avail, and the next half-hour saw her as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before. At last Emma attacked her on another ground."," Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation. Emma continued,  ""I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than my comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what is your duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others, to save your health and credit, and restore your tranquillity."
"Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation. Emma continued,"," This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest. The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she really loved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence of grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably."

""There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,"" said she afterwards to herself."
"Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!"" Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well, nor valued her affection so highly before.","   CHAPTER XIV   Mrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or not pretty at all. Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects; and she made a point of Harriet's going with her, that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible."
"Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too; but she behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent. The visit was of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one, beyond the nothing-meaning terms of being"," She did not really like her. She would not be in a hurry to find fault, but she suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not elegance.-- She was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, there was too much ease."
"It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it. The woman was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense to depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he had been expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as could be."," There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer. ""Oh!"
"""Well, Miss Woodhouse,"" said Harriet, when they had quitted the house, and after waiting in vain for her friend to begin; ""Well, Miss Woodhouse, (with a gentle sigh,) what do you think of her?--Is not she very charming?"" There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer."," ""I think her beautiful, quite beautiful."" ""Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown."""
"""Oh! yes--very--a very pleasing young woman."""," ""Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown."" ""I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love."""

""Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the woman who loves him best."
"""Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune; and she came in his way."""," ""Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the woman who loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought this the best offer she was likely to have."""

"""Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the woman who loves him best. Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought this the best offer she was likely to have."""," When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind. She could then see more and judge better."
"The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of the alliance, and his place and his carriages were the pride of him. The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove,","-a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove. The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was modern and well-built."
"""Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She was quite struck by the likeness!--That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room at Maple Grove; her sister's favourite room.""--Mr. Elton was appealed to.--""Was not it astonishingly like?--She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove.""","with a little sigh of sentiment). A charming place, undoubtedly."
I have spent so many happy months there! (with a little sigh of sentiment).," Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself. ""So extremely like Maple Grove!"
"I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony."" Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself."," Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment. She had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to attack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply,  ""When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield."

"It is the garden of England, you know. Surry is the garden of England."""," ""No, I fancy not,"" replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile. ""I never heard any county but Surry called so."""
"""Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction. Many counties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as Surry."""," Emma was silenced.

"I think, on the contrary, when people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little.

The idea of her being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an _introduction_--of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs. Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--The dignity of Miss Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!"
"She restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she could have given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; ""but their going to Bath was quite out of the question; and she was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her better than her father."" And then, to prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly."," ""Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea."

"""Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for""--  Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,"," ""Is not she? Then she is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld."""
"Selina is no fine lady, I assure you. Do not run away with such an idea."""," Mrs. Elton began to think she had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly. It was by no means her object to have it believed that her sister was _not_ a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it;--and she was considering in what way she had best retract, when Mr. Weston went on."

"Besides, she is out of health now; but _that_ indeed, by her own account, she has always been. I would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith in Mrs. Churchill's illness.""","""She has taken it into her head that Enscombe is too cold for her. The fact is, I suppose, that she is tired of Enscombe."
"""If she is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To Bath, or to Clifton?"""," ""Aye--like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retired from the road than Maple Grove."
"It is a retired place. A fine place, but very retired."""," ""Frank was here in February for a fortnight."" ""So I remember to have heard."
"Or, perhaps she may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life. I always say a woman cannot have too many resources--and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society."""," ""So I remember to have heard. He will find an _addition_ to the society of Highbury when he comes again; that is, if I may presume to call myself an addition."
"I always say a woman cannot have too many resources--and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society."" ""Frank was here in February for a fortnight."""," This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr. Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,  ""My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible."
"But perhaps he may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world."" This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr. Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,"," He had done his duty and could return to his son. ""When Frank left us,"" continued he, ""it was quite uncertain when we might see him again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome."
"Elton."" He had done his duty and could return to his son."," ""Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when, because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his feelings, he was apt to be in despair, and exclaim that he was sure at this rate it would be _May_ before Hymen's saffron robe would be put on for us."
"and so forth--I always felt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has, you see. I have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if things are going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next."""," She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on. ""You were mentioning May."
"The carriage--we had disappointments about the carriage;--one morning, I remember, he came to me quite in despair."" She was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on."," ""And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his favour. I have heard so much in praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am one of those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means implicitly guided by others."
"Mrs. Weston's partiality for him is very great, and, as you may suppose, most gratifying to me. She thinks nobody equal to him."""," Mr. Weston was musing. ""I hope,"" said he presently, ""I have not been severe upon poor Mrs. Churchill."
"I give you notice that as I find your son, so I shall judge of him.--I am no flatterer."" Mr. Weston was musing."," ""Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking!"
"And what inclines one less to bear, she has no fair pretence of family or blood. She was nobody when he married her, barely the daughter of a gentleman; but ever since her being turned into a Churchill she has out-Churchill'd them all in high and mighty claims: but in herself, I assure you, she is an upstart."""," They were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, having said all that he wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away."
Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his brother. He was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with--," ""I rather hope to satisfy you both,"" said Emma, ""for I shall do all in my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic."" ""And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again."""
"He was to leave them early the next day; and he soon began with--  ""Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise than her's, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic them."""," ""And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again.""

"A little while ago, every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole's, or balls at the Crown.

"Let them be sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure."""," Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him. VOLUME III    CHAPTER I   A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the nature of her agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill."
"He was looking about, he was going to the door, he was watching for the sound of other carriages,--impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her. Mrs. Elton was spoken of."," A carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming back, said,  ""I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her."
"A carriage was heard. He was on the move immediately; but coming back, said,"," Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed. ""But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!"""
"I have no business to put myself forward."" Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed.", The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now.
"He was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion, by giving her very proper attention, after the introduction had passed. In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--","and away he went. Mr. Weston was following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinion of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself, though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing."
"In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--""I will see that there are umbrellas, sir,"" said Frank to his father: ""Miss Bates must not be forgotten:"" and away he went. Mr. Weston was following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinion of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself, though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing."," While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained; but when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.

Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston."," Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs. Weston's to receive them. Her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, every body's words, were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in talking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire."

As the door opened she was heard,"," Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little way behind her.--He was thoughtful. Whether he were overhearing too, she could not determine."
"Whether he were overhearing too, she could not determine. After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself--and it was,","-with many other relative questions, all answered with patient politeness. Mrs. Elton then said, ""Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do--but upon such an occasion as this, when every body's eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons--who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wish to be inferior to others."
"--with many other relative questions, all answered with patient politeness. Mrs. Elton then said,"," At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hear more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till another suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctly forward.--Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,  ""Oh!"

"""Ungrateful!--What do you mean?"" Then changing from a frown to a smile--"," Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour. He walked off to find his father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. and Mrs. Weston."
"He had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be laid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude."," Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed."
"She was not yet dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little she saw it all. When she was half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that his wife, who was standing immediately above her, was not only listening also, but even encouraging him by significant glances.--The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say,","to which his prompt reply was, ""Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me."" ""Me!--oh!"
"Elton?"" to which his prompt reply was,"," ""Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself."
"Elton?"" to which his prompt reply was, ""Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me."""," ""If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,"" said he, ""I shall have great pleasure, I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert."""
"no--I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no dancer."""," ""Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith."" ""Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--and if I were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston."
"""If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,"" said he, ""I shall have great pleasure, I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert.""","""Miss Smith!--oh!--I had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--and if I were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston.

"Gilbert."" ""Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith.""", Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat. This was Mr. Elton!
"Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) very foolish. She did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife, though growing very like her;--_she_ spoke some of her feelings, by observing audibly to her partner,"," Supper was announced.

"Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat, and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some of her throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were amused, and who were your partners. 'Oh!'"," shall not forestall Jane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell you all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton, I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.'

"""Indeed I will.

It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which she walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike; and his praise of Harriet, his concession in her favour, was peculiarly gratifying."
"The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her nephews:--in her imagination it maintained its ground, and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the gipsies, and still tenaciously setting her right if she varied in the slightest particular from the original recital. CHAPTER IV   A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting down and hesitating, thus began:"," Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak. There was a seriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her, quite as much as her words, for something more than ordinary."

"As I am happily quite an altered creature in _one_ _respect_, it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than is necessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and I dare say you understand me."""," ""How I could so long a time be fancying myself!..."" cried Harriet, warmly."
"I do not want to say more than is necessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and I dare say you understand me."" ""Yes,"" said Emma, ""I hope I do.""","cried Harriet, warmly. ""It seems like madness!"
"""How I could so long a time be fancying myself!..."" cried Harriet, warmly.","said she, with a conscious look. ""Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?"""
"Cannot you guess what this parcel holds?"" said she, with a conscious look."," ""No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued very much."" She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words _Most_ _precious_ _treasures_ on the top."
"said she, with a conscious look. ""Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?"""," She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words _Most_ _precious_ _treasures_ on the top. Her curiosity was greatly excited."
"Harriet unfolded the parcel, and she looked on with impatience. Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box, which Harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but, excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister."," ""No, indeed I do not."" ""Dear me!"
"Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box, which Harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but, excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister. ""Now,"" said Harriet, ""you _must_ recollect."""," ""Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last times we ever met in it!--It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat--just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came--I think the very evening.--Do not you remember his cutting his finger with your new penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?--But, as you had none about you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him; and so I took mine out and cut him a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and he cut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before he gave it back to me."
"""Now,"" said Harriet, ""you _must_ recollect."" ""No, indeed I do not."""," ""My dearest Harriet!"" cried Emma, putting her hand before her face, and jumping up, ""you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear."

I am sure I never suspected it, you did it so naturally."""
"Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this relic--I knew nothing of that till this moment--but the cutting the finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none about me!--Oh! my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in my pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)--go on--what else?"""," ""And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!"" said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement."
"""And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspected it, you did it so naturally."""," said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement. And secretly she added to herself, ""Lord bless me!"
"said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement. And secretly she added to herself,"," ""Here,"" resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, ""here is something still more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable, because this is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister never did."" Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure."
"when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about! I never was equal to this."""," Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of an old pencil,--the part without any lead."
"Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of an old pencil,--the part without any lead."," ""I do remember it,"" cried Emma; ""I perfectly remember it.--Talking about spruce-beer.--Oh! yes--Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too."
"Mr. Knightley had been telling him something about brewing spruce-beer, and he wanted to put it down; but when he took out his pencil, there was so little lead that he soon cut it all away, and it would not do, so you lent him another, and this was left upon the table as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment."""," ""Ah! I do not know."
"I perfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, was not he? I have an idea he was standing just here.""","-  ""Well, go on."" ""Oh!"
"Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where I am now."" --"," ""Oh! that's all."
"Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where I am now."" --  ""Well, go on."""," ""My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things?"""
"that's all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to see me do it."""," ""Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married."
"""My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things?"""," ""But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be useful."" ""I shall be happier to burn it,"" replied Harriet."
"It was very wrong of me, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he was married. I knew it was--but had not resolution enough to part with them."""," ""I shall be happier to burn it,"" replied Harriet. ""It has a disagreeable look to me."
"I knew it was--but had not resolution enough to part with them."" ""But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be useful."""," ""And when,"" thought Emma, ""will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?"""
"of Mr. Elton."""," She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had _told_ no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a fortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and quite undesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which made the information she received more valuable."
"Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which made the information she received more valuable. She merely said, in the course of some trivial chat, ""Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so""--and thought no more of it, till after a minute's silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone,"," Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a moment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,  ""Never marry!--This is a new resolution."" ""It is one that I shall never change, however."""

"After another short hesitation, ""I hope it does not proceed from--I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?"""," She then took a longer time for consideration. Should she proceed no farther?--should she let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?--Perhaps Harriet might think her cold or angry if she did; or perhaps if she were totally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her to hear too much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been, such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she was perfectly resolved.--She believed it would be wiser for her to say and know at once, all that she meant to say and know."
"Plain dealing was always best. She had previously determined how far she would proceed, on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.--She was decided, and thus spoke--"," ""Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose-- Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance--and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so proper, in me especially."""
"Your resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?"""," ""I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart."""
"""Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose-- Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance--and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so proper, in me especially."""," ""Service! oh!"
"""I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart."""," ""It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable.--Yes, honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.--But that it will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise."
"In one moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!""", Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her friend.
"As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback. The gentlemen spoke of his horse."," Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, ""I did not know that he ever had any such plan."" ""Nay, I had it from you."
"""By the bye,"" said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, ""what became of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his carriage?"" Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said,"," ""Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago."""
"""By the bye,"" said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, ""what became of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his carriage?"" Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, ""I did not know that he ever had any such plan."""," ""Me! impossible!"""
"""Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago."""," ""Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly."
"""Me! impossible!"""," ""Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment."" ""Never!"
"It was owing to _her_ persuasion, as she thought his being out in bad weather did him a great deal of harm. You must remember it now?"""," ""Never! really, never!--Bless me!"
"You must remember it now?"" ""Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment."""," ""What is this?--What is this?"" cried Mr. Weston, ""about Perry and a carriage?"
"how could it be?--Then I must have dreamt it--but I was completely persuaded--Miss Smith, you walk as if you were tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at home."""," ""No, sir,"" replied his son, laughing, ""I seem to have had it from nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with all these particulars--but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a great dreamer."
"I am glad he can afford it. You had it from himself, had you?"""," ""It is odd though,"" observed his father, ""that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry's setting up his carriage!"
"I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away--and when I have gone through my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry."""," Emma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of Mr. Weston's hint."
"Emma was out of hearing. She had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of Mr. Weston's hint.", They were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded Miss Bates's in a glance at Jane.
"The dream must be borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield, and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, on which two of his daily meals had, for forty years been crowded. Tea passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move."," Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming words for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled."
"He saw a short word prepared for Emma, and given to her with a look sly and demure. He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly entertaining, though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure; for she said,","He heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane, ""I will give it to her--shall I?"" --and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth."
"for shame!"" He heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane,","-and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth. ""No, no, you must not; you shall not, indeed."""
"He heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane, ""I will give it to her--shall I?"" --and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth."," It was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love without feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her to study it."
"Jane Fairfax's perception seemed to accompany his; her comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. She was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only,","pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered. Her face was averted from those who had made the attack, and turned towards her aunt."
"She was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only, ""I did not know that proper names were allowed,"" pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered. Her face was averted from those who had made the attack, and turned towards her aunt."," Jane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived. She was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; but so many were also moving, that she could not get away; and Mr. Knightley thought he saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her, and resolutely swept away by her unexamined."
"He could not see her in a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her. It was his duty."," Emma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the true explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them."
"Emma was extremely confused. She could not endure to give him the true explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them."," ""The joke,"" he replied gravely, ""seemed confined to you and Mr. Churchill."""
"""Oh!"" she cried in evident embarrassment, ""it all meant nothing; a mere joke among ourselves."""," He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not. She would rather busy herself about any thing than speak."
"Yet he would speak. He owed it to her, to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference, rather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause."," ""Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh!"
"He owed it to her, to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference, rather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause. ""My dear Emma,"" said he at last, with earnest kindness, ""do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?"""," ""Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or that she admired him?"" ""Never, never!"""
"Oh! yes, perfectly.--Why do you make a doubt of it?"""," ""Never, never!"" she cried with a most open eagerness--""Never, for the twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me."
"yes, perfectly.--Why do you make a doubt of it?"" ""Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or that she admired him?"""," ""I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them--certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be public."" ""Oh!"
"she cried with a most open eagerness--""Never, for the twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. And how could it possibly come into your head?"""," ""Oh! you amuse me excessively."
"And how could it possibly come into your head?"" ""I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them--certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be public."""," She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction which silenced, Mr. Knightley. She was in gay spirits, and would have prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her: but his gaiety did not meet hers."
"Now, as her objection was nothing but her very great dislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware, it was not worth bringing forward again:--it could not be done without a reproof to him, which would be giving pain to his wife; and she found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would probably expose her even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs. Elton's party! Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper."," Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private. It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton was growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty."
"It might be weeks, it might be only a few days, before the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured on, and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton's resources were inadequate to such an attack."," ""You had better explore to Donwell,"" replied Mr. Knightley. ""That may be done without horses."
"What are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing done. Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston."""," If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so, for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the ""Oh! I should like it of all things,"" was not plainer in words than manner."
"They are ripening fast."" If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so, for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the","was not plainer in words than manner. Donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation: but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere."
"Donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation: but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. She promised him again and again to come--much oftener than he doubted--and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment as she chose to consider it."," ""I cannot name a day,"" said he, ""till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you."" ""Oh!"
"Name your day, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?"""," ""Oh! leave all that to me."
"You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?"" ""I cannot name a day,"" said he, ""till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you."""," ""I hope you will bring Elton,"" said he: ""but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations."" ""Oh!"
"It is my party. I will bring friends with me."""," ""Oh! now you are looking very sly."
"I will bring friends with me."" ""I hope you will bring Elton,"" said he: ""but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations."""," ""No,""--he calmly replied,--""there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she pleases to Donwell, and that one is--""  ""--Mrs. Weston, I suppose,"" interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified. ""No--Mrs. Knightley;--and till she is in being, I will manage such matters myself."""

""That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:--but as you like."
"Don't scruple. I know you are attached to them."""," ""That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day:--but as you like. It is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing."
"I know you are attached to them."" ""You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home."""," ""Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining-room."
"Every thing as natural and simple as possible. Is not that your idea?"""," ""Well--as you please; only don't have a great set out. And, by the bye, can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--Pray be sincere, Knightley."
"The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is best observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house."""," ""I have not the least wish for it, I thank you."" ""Well--but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremely clever."""
"And, by the bye, can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--Pray be sincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, or to inspect anything--"""," ""Well--but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremely clever.""

Donwell Lane is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry."
"I really must talk to him about purchasing a donkey. In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever so many resources, it is not possible for her to be always shut up at home;--and very long walks, you know--in summer there is dust, and in winter there is dirt."""," ""That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend."
"You can borrow Mrs. Cole's. I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible."""," Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade. He wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party; and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at Donwell, be tempted away to his misery."
"She had given them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush. These were pleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the strawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or talking--strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or spoken of.--"," Such, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only once by Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to inquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.--She had some fears of his horse. Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.--A situation, a most desirable situation, was in question."
"Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused. Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him, and now he would shew them all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw, for he was slow, constant, and methodical.--Before this second looking over was begun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments' free observation of the entrance and ground-plot of the house--and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly in from the garden, and with a look of escape.--Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of."," ""Certainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone?"" ""Yes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast."
"Some are gone to the ponds, and some to the lime walk. Till they all come in I shall not be missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I am gone?"""," ""Yes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast. I shall be at home in twenty minutes."""
"Till they all come in I shall not be missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I am gone?"" ""Certainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone?"""," ""But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let my father's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage."
"""Yes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast. I shall be at home in twenty minutes."""," ""Thank you, thank you--but on no account.--I would rather walk.--And for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone!--I, who may so soon have to guard others!"" She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, ""That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now."
"Let my father's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage. It can be round in five minutes."""," She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, ""That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I must order the carriage."
"""Thank you, thank you--but on no account.--I would rather walk.--And for _me_ to be afraid of walking alone!--I, who may so soon have to guard others!"" She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied,"," ""I am,""--she answered--""I am fatigued; but it is not the sort of fatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse, we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, are exhausted."
"I must order the carriage. The heat even would be danger.--You are fatigued already."""," Emma had not another word to oppose. She saw it all; and entering into her feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend."
"She saw it all; and entering into her feelings, promoted her quitting the house immediately, and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend. Her parting look was grateful--and her parting words,","-seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her, even towards some of those who loved her best.

"Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of being sometimes alone!"" --seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her, even towards some of those who loved her best."," Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only accomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when Frank Churchill entered the room. Emma had not been thinking of him, she had forgotten to think of him--but she was very glad to see him."
"He had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her; a nervous seizure, which had lasted some hours--and he had quite given up every thought of coming, till very late;--and had he known how hot a ride he should have, and how late, with all his hurry, he must be, he believed he should not have come at all. The heat was excessive; he had never suffered any thing like it--almost wished he had staid at home--nothing killed him like heat--he could bear any degree of cold, etc., but heat was intolerable--and he sat down, at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse's fire, looking very deplorable.","said Emma. ""As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again."

""You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,"" said Emma."," Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill's state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour. Some people were always cross when they were hot."
"In two minutes, however, he relented in his own favour; and muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. Emma returned all her attention to her father, saying in secret--"," He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came back all the better--grown quite cool--and, with good manners, like himself--able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest in their employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be so late. He was not in his best spirits, but seemed trying to improve them; and, at last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably."
"He was not in his best spirits, but seemed trying to improve them; and, at last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably. They were looking over views in Swisserland."," ""That may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go to Swisserland."
"You will have my sketches, some time or other, to look at--or my tour to read--or my poem. I shall do something to expose myself."""," ""They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed for her."
"You will never go to Swisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England."""," ""You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?"""
"I want a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy--I am sick of England--and would leave it to-morrow, if I could."""," ""_I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken."
"""You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?"""," ""You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go and eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well."
"I am thwarted in every thing material. I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person."""," ""No--I shall not stir. I shall sit by you."
"Go and eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Another slice of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us."""," ""We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;--you will join us. It is not Swisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change."
"I shall sit by you. You are my best cure."""," ""No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening."" ""But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning."""

What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the accumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge of the servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill--which messenger, however, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horse seeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy going a good pace, and driving very steady."
"There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and it caught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind. The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's importance in the world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her; one was every thing, the other nothing--and she sat musing on the difference of woman's destiny, and quite unconscious on what her eyes were fixed, till roused by Miss Bates's saying,"," Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing, that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt, took leave. CHAPTER IX   Emma's pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted; but on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her."
"Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were sitting with her father.--Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner decidedly graver than usual, said,"," ""Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?"""
"I am going to London, to spend a few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say, besides the 'love,' which nobody carries?"""," ""Yes--rather--I have been thinking of it some little time."" Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself."
"""Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?"""," Emma was sure he had not forgiven her; he looked unlike himself. Time, however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends again."
"Time, however, she thought, would tell him that they ought to be friends again. While he stood, as if meaning to go, but not going--her father began his inquiries."," Emma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile, and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr. Knightley.--It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour, as if his eyes received the truth from hers, and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured.-- He looked at her with a glow of regard."
"In the hope of diverting her father's thoughts from the disagreeableness of Mr. Knightley's going to London; and going so suddenly; and going on horseback, which she knew would be all very bad; Emma communicated her news of Jane Fairfax, and her dependence on the effect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,--interested, without disturbing him. He had long made up his mind to Jane Fairfax's going out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully, but Mr. Knightley's going to London had been an unexpected blow.", The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else into the background. An express arrived at Randalls to announce the death of Mrs. Churchill!
"Mr. Churchill would never get over it."" --Even Mr. Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said,","and resolved, that his mourning should be as handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady. How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both."
"CHAPTER X   One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease, Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who ""could not stay five minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her."" --He met her at the parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father,"," ""Is she unwell?"" ""No, no, not at all--only a little agitated."
"Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you."""," ""No, no, not at all--only a little agitated. She would have ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_, and that you know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?"""
"She must see you."" ""Is she unwell?""","odding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?"" ""Certainly."
"""No, no, not at all--only a little agitated. She would have ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_, and that you know--(nodding towards her father"," ""Certainly. This moment, if you please."
"""No, no, not at all--only a little agitated. She would have ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she must see you _alone_, and that you know--(nodding towards her father)--Humph!--Can you come?"""," ""Depend upon me--but ask no more questions. You will know it all in time."
"It is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?--Is she really not ill?"""," To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. Something really important seemed announced by his looks; but, as her friend was well, she endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her father, that she would take her walk now, she and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls."

"She will break it to you better than I can. Do not be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon."""," ""No, indeed you are mistaken."" --  ""Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square."

She asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy, and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family,--something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward."
"Half a dozen natural children, perhaps--and poor Frank cut off!--This, though very undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. It inspired little more than an animating curiosity.","said she, as they proceeded--speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret, than with any other view. ""I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank, I assure you."
"""Who is that gentleman on horseback?"" said she, as they proceeded--speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his secret, than with any other view."," ""Has your son been with you, then?"" ""Oh!"
"You will not see him. He is half way to Windsor by this time."""," ""Oh! yes--did not you know?--Well, well, never mind."""
"He is half way to Windsor by this time."" ""Has your son been with you, then?"""," For a moment he was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded and demure,  ""Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.""

"I shall not be far off, if you want me."" --And Emma distinctly heard him add, in a lower tone, before he quitted the room,--"," Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation, that Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she eagerly said,  ""What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, I find, has occurred;--do let me know directly what it is."
"She has not the least idea."" Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation, that Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she eagerly said,"," ""Have you indeed no idea?"" said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice."
"Do not let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of your distress, whatever it may be."""," ""So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess."" ""You are right."
"said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice. ""Cannot you, my dear Emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear?"""," ""You are right. It does relate to him, and I will tell you directly;""  (resuming her work, and seeming resolved against looking up.)"

But it is even so."
"You are not serious? You do not mean it?"""," Emma scarcely heard what was said.--Her mind was divided between two ideas--her own former conversations with him about Miss Fairfax; and poor Harriet;--and for some time she could only exclaim, and require confirmation, repeated confirmation. ""Well,"" said she at last, trying to recover herself; ""this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at all comprehend it."
"I can hardly believe it.--I thought I knew him.""

It has hurt his father equally."
"""Well,"" said she at last, trying to recover herself; ""this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at all comprehend it. What!--engaged to her all the winter--before either of them came to Highbury?"""," Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, ""I will not pretend _not_ to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are apprehensive of."" Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance was as steady as her words."
"_Some_ _part_ of his conduct we cannot excuse."" Emma pondered a moment, and then replied,"," Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance was as steady as her words. ""That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my present perfect indifference,"" she continued, ""I will farther tell you, that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I did like him, when I was very much disposed to be attached to him--nay, was attached--and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder."
"Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, ""I will not pretend _not_ to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured that no such effect has followed his attentions to me, as you are apprehensive of."" Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance was as steady as her words."," Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could find utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do. ""Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,"" said she."
"This is the simple truth."" Mrs. Weston kissed her with tears of joy; and when she could find utterance, assured her, that this protestation had done her more good than any thing else in the world could do."," ""I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit _him_, Mrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him greatly to blame."

It was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other--and we were persuaded that it was so.-- Imagine what we have been feeling on your account."""," ""From something that he said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine--""  ""And how could _she_ bear such behaviour! Composure with a witness!"
"What right had he to come among us with affection and faith engaged, and with manners so _very_ disengaged? What right had he to endeavour to please, as he certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention, as he certainly did--while he really belonged to another?--How could he tell what mischief he might be doing?--How could he tell that he might not be making me in love with him?--very wrong, very wrong indeed."""," ""And how could _she_ bear such behaviour!

"He was here only a quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he could stay--but that there had been misunderstandings he decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed, seemed to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his conduct."""," ""Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his part; for though he has been wrong in this instance, I have known him long enough to answer for his having many, very many, good qualities; and--""  ""Good God!"" cried Emma, not attending to her.--""Mrs."
"Much, much beyond impropriety!--It has sunk him, I cannot say how it has sunk him in my opinion.

"They burst on him, I do not know how, but by some letter or message--and it was the discovery of what she was doing, of this very project of hers, which determined him to come forward at once, own it all to his uncle, throw himself on his kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long."" Emma began to listen better."," ""_His_ sufferings,"" replied Emma dryly, ""do not appear to have done him much harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?"""

"While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have been a hope, a chance, a possibility;--but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required. What a blessing it is, when undue influence does not survive the grave!--He gave his consent with very little persuasion."""," ""This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this morning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy, some time--and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.--He was very much agitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before.--In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of--and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal."""

And how much may be said in her situation for even that error!""","the world is not their's, nor the world's law.'"" She met Mr. Weston on his entrance, with a smiling countenance, exclaiming,  ""A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word!"
"""If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax's.--Of such, one may almost say, that 'the world is not their's, nor the world's law.'""

His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on the subject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing."
"His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence, or smooth objections; and by the time they had talked it all over together, and he had talked it all over again with Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could possibly have done. CHAPTER XI","-Those were the words; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted the real misery of the business to her. Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by herself--very ill in many ways,--but it was not so much _his_ behaviour as her _own_, which made her so angry with him."
"And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them.--She felt that she had been risking her friend's happiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself to think of him, and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her.--"," She was extremely angry with herself. If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.--As for Jane Fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account."
"Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had poor Mrs. Weston felt when _she_ was approaching Randalls.

"""What did Mr. Weston tell you?"" --said Emma, still perplexed."," It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd, that Emma did not know how to understand it. Her character appeared absolutely changed."
"She seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery. Emma looked at her, quite unable to speak."," ""Upon my word,"" said Emma, ""I begin to doubt my having any such talent.

When Harriet had closed her evidence, she appealed to her dear Miss Woodhouse, to say whether she had not good ground for hope."," The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter feelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side, to enable her to say on reply,  ""Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does."" Harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which at that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her father's footsteps."

Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her companion, pent up within her own mind as every thing had so long been, and was very much pleased with all that she had said on the subject."," ""Poor girl!"" said Emma."
"This was one of her expressions.

"Her affection must have overpowered her judgment."" ""Yes, I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him."""," ""On your side, my love, it was very innocently done.

He has had great faults, faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his opinion in thinking him likely to be happier than he deserves: but still as he is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her, I am very ready to believe his character will improve, and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants."
"""You do not appear so well satisfied with his letter as I am; but still you must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him for it. I hope it does him some service with you."""," The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the happiness of her father. Emma's answer was ready at the first word."
"She promised to think of it, and advised him to think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject. He had given it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning, to have his thoughts to himself."," She promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised, moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme. It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry, whose rights as heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded."
"She went--she had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her with compassion, though all the worst of her sufferings had been unsuspected.--The fear of being still unwelcome, determined her, though assured of their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her name.--She heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No; she heard nothing but the instant reply of, ""Beg her to walk up;""--and a moment afterwards she was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no other reception of her were felt sufficient.--Emma had never seen her look so well, so lovely, so engaging. There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every thing which her countenance or manner could ever have wanted.-- She came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very feeling tone,"," Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not checked her, and made it expedient to compress all her friendly and all her congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand. Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together."
"She soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts, and understand why she was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in Miss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people. Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her face; and while paying her own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady's replies, she saw her with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her side, saying, with significant nods,"," And again, on Emma's merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates's knitting, she added, in a half whisper,  ""I mentioned no _names_, you will observe.--Oh! no; cautious as a minister of state."
"But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.--_My_ representation, you see, has quite appeased her."" And again, on Emma's merely turning her head to look at Mrs. Bates's knitting, she added, in a half whisper,"," Emma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on every possible occasion."
"It was a palpable display, repeated on every possible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,","ere was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.) Upon my word, Perry has restored her in a wonderful short time!--Oh!"
"It was a palpable display, repeated on every possible occasion. When they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and Mrs. Weston, she found herself abruptly addressed with,  ""Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered?--Do not you think her cure does Perry the highest credit?--(here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.)","-And when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther, ""We do not say a word of any _assistance_ that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh! no; Perry shall have all the credit."""

""Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It is impossible to say--Yes, indeed, I quite understand--dearest Jane's prospects--that is, I do not mean.--But she is charmingly recovered.--How is Mr."

"Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I would not have such a creature as his Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration.

She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston."
"She would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her, hereafter, with either of Isabella's sons; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best. It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew older--and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence--to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston--no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach, should not have their powers in exercise again."," ""That is,"" replied Mr. Knightley, ""she will indulge her even more than she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all.

"""That is,"" replied Mr. Knightley, ""she will indulge her even more than she did you, and believe that she does not indulge her at all. It will be the only difference."""," ""Nothing very bad.--The fate of thousands. She will be disagreeable in infancy, and correct herself as she grows older."

"The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much without doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least."""," ""How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your saucy looks--'Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I may, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'--something which, you knew, I did not approve."

This, on his side, might merely proceed from her not being thought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy, and a suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship were declining."
"Emma's comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet's being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least. Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August, and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back."," It was the answer to the communication of his intended marriage.

"He had no idea of me. He seems perfectly unprepared for that."""," The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other persons' reception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first to announce it at home, and then at Randalls.--But how to break it to her father at last!--She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of Mr. Knightley's absence, or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.--She was forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too."
"And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!--The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband's plans and her own, for a marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had been a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than by herself--but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying--","But here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It was all right, all open, all equal."
"If any thing could increase her delight, it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps. The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.--He saw the advantages of the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it."," He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that point. He told her the news."
"One set might recommend their all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements among their servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious objection raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.--There, the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped ""the young lady's pride would now be contented;"" and supposed ""she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could;"" and, on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim,","-But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--""Poor Knightley! poor fellow!--sad business for him."""

But that would be all over now.--Poor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for _her_."
"It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her, when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After the first chat of pleasure he was silent; and then, in a graver tone, began with,"," ""Good or bad?"" said she, quickly, looking up in his face."

"cried he. ""You have, I believe, and know the whole."""," ""You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is. Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin."""
"""You have, I believe, and know the whole."" ""No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me."""," Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--and her eyes, in eager gaze, said, ""No, this is impossible!"" but her lips were closed."
"Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--and her eyes, in eager gaze, said, ""No, this is impossible!"" but her lips were closed."," She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement. ""You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were the same."
"He left me not half an hour ago."" She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement."," ""You mistake me, you quite mistake me,"" she replied, exerting herself. ""It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I cannot believe it."
"But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will make one or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need not talk much on the subject."""," ""I mean that he has done it,"" answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but determined decision, ""and been accepted."" ""Good God!"""

"How, where, when?--Let me know it all. I never was more surprized--but it does not make me unhappy, I assure you.--How--how has it been possible?"""," He stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak, she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness."
"She must wait a moment, or he would think her mad.

I think Harriet is doing extremely well."
"His rank in society I would alter if I could, which is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me about William Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin."" He wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly--she did--cheerfully answering,"," ""You ought to know your friend best,"" replied Mr. Knightley; ""but I should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her.""

"""You ought to know your friend best,"" replied Mr. Knightley; ""but I should say she was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told her he loved her."" Emma could not help laughing as she answered,"," The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings, and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet's side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such emphasis, ""No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,"" that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature. It could not be otherwise."

"I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer.

Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her father."
"They arrived.--Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--but hardly had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for coming, which he asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the blind, of two figures passing near the window.", In half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad to see him--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of embarrassing recollections on each side.
"They met readily and smiling, but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle, that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she had long felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him with Jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joined the party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animation--or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her and say,"," ""No, indeed,"" cried Emma, most happy to begin, ""not in the least. I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give you joy in person."""
"I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said."""," He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness. ""Is not she looking well?"""
