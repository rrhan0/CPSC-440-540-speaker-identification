"I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him.""","   CHAPTER II   Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family, which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property."
"But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh, and saying,", There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.
"Such another small basin of thin gruel as his own was all that he could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he might constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things, to say:"," Emma allowed her father to talk--but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy."
"Emma encouraged her talkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings, and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs. Martin's having"," For some time she was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate cause; but as she came to understand the family better, other feelings arose."
She was in no hurry at all.," ""And when she had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever seen."
"""You know what you are about."""," ""Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of his own business?"
"Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with her."""," ""Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know--but I believe he has read a good deal--but not what you would think any thing of."
"He does not read?"""," The next question was--  ""What sort of looking man is Mr."
The next question was--," ""Oh!"
"Martin?"""," ""That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having any idea of his name."
"He has passed you very often."""," ""To be sure."
"But a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice as in every other he is below it."""," ""I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man."
"It is not likely you should ever have observed him; but he knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight."""," ""He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference--which is very odd."""

"Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it might be very desirable."""," ""Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not born to an independence."
"Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!"""," ""To be sure, so it is."
"Whatever money he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of the family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his stock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may be rich in time, it is next to impossible that he should have realised any thing yet."""," ""I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does marry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife--for though his sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected to, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you to notice."
"They have no indoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year."""," ""Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are."
"There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman's daughter, and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you."""," ""You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I would have you so firmly established in good society, as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse."
"But while I visit at Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any body can do."""," ""To be sure."
"I want to see you permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted with the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer's daughter, without education."""," Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no alarming symptoms of love."
"They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face, and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose."," ""He is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is nothing compared with his entire want of gentility."
"Do you think him so very plain?"""," ""To be sure,"" said Harriet, in a mortified voice, ""he is not so genteel as real gentlemen."""
"I had imagined him, I confess, a degree or two nearer gentility."""," ""I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin."
"""To be sure,"" said Harriet, in a mortified voice, ""he is not so genteel as real gentlemen."""," ""Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley."
"I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward look and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here."""," ""Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr. Martin with _him_."
"But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!"""," ""Oh yes!--there is a great difference."
"You must see the difference."""," ""Which makes his good manners the more valuable."
"Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty."""," ""There is no saying, indeed,"" replied Harriet rather solemnly."
"Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr. Weston's time of life?""",replied Harriet rather solemnly.
"""There is no saying, indeed,"" replied Harriet rather solemnly."," ""Will he, indeed?"
"He will be a completely gross, vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of nothing but profit and loss."""," ""How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the circumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended."
"That will be very bad."""," ""I wonder he did not remember the book""--was all Harriet's answer, and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself."
"And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive, and be a very rich man in time--and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb _us_.""","-was all Harriet's answer, and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself."
"Her next beginning was,"," She then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled, and said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable."
CHAPTER V," ""A bad thing!"
"CHAPTER V   ""I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,"" said Mr. Knightley, ""of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a bad thing."""," ""I think they will neither of them do the other any good."""
"Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so?"""," ""You surprize me!"
"""I think they will neither of them do the other any good."""," ""Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle."""
"Knightley."""," ""Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he were here, for he thinks exactly as I do on the subject."
"""Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle."""," ""Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years old."
"She means it, I know."""," ""I dare say,"" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, ""that I thought so _then_;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's omitting to do any thing I wished."""
"Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade her to read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not."""," ""There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,""--said Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done."
"""I dare say,"" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, ""that I thought so _then_;--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's omitting to do any thing I wished.""","-said Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done."
"""There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,""--said Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done."," ""I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on _your_ recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted another situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body."
"She inherits her mother's talents, and must have been under subjection to her."""," ""Yes,"" said he, smiling."
"I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held."""," ""Thank you."
"You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_, on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor."""," ""Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne."
"Weston."""," ""I hope not _that_.--It is not likely."
"Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort, or his son may plague him."""," ""Not I, indeed."
"No, Mr. Knightley, do not foretell vexation from that quarter."""," ""I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am more anxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance."
"I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in life.--They only give a little polish."""," ""Oh!"
"How well she looked last night!"""," ""Pretty!"
"Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty."""," ""I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers."
"Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether--face and figure?"""," ""Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant!"
"But I am a partial old friend."""," ""I have not a fault to find with her person,"" he replied."
"Mr. Knightley, is not she?"""," ""And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm."
"Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm."""," ""Very well; I will not plague you any more."
"No, no; she has qualities which may be trusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundred times."""," ""I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind; but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself, you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma's mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you."
"I am sure of having their opinions with me."""," ""Not at all,"" cried he; ""I am much obliged to you for it."
"It has been so many years my province to give advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this little remains of office."""," ""Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about her sister."""
"It is very good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found; for it shall be attended to."""," ""Be satisfied,"" said he, ""I will not raise any outcry."
"""Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about her sister."""," ""So do I,"" said Mrs. Weston gently, ""very much."""
"I wonder what will become of her!"""," ""She always declares she will never marry, which, of course, means just nothing at all."
"""So do I,"" said Mrs. Weston gently, ""very much."""," ""There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her to break her resolution at present,"" said Mrs. Weston, ""as can well be; and while she is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse's account."
"But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her; and she goes so seldom from home."""," Part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible."
"There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it was not desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to",convinced her that he had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield.
"His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet's manner, since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment."," ""I am glad you think I have been useful to her; but Harriet only wanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints."
"She was a beautiful creature when she came to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she received from nature."""," ""If it were admissible to contradict a lady,"" said the gallant Mr. Elton--  ""I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before."""
"I have done very little.""","said the gallant Mr. Elton--  ""I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before."""
"""If it were admissible to contradict a lady,"" said the gallant Mr. Elton--"," ""Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me."
"""If it were admissible to contradict a lady,"" said the gallant Mr. Elton--  ""I have perhaps given her a little more decision of character, have taught her to think on points which had not fallen in her way before."""," ""Great has been the pleasure, I am sure."
"Skilful has been the hand!"""," ""I have no doubt of it."""
"I never met with a disposition more truly amiable.""","And it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation, which had a vast deal of the lover."
"She was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he seconded a sudden wish of hers, to have Harriet's picture."," Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say, with a very interesting naivete,  ""Oh!"
"Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say, with a very interesting naivete,"," No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,  ""What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be!"
"No sooner was she out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,"," ""Let me entreat you,"" cried Mr. Elton; ""it would indeed be a delight!"
"It would be such a delight to have her picture!"""," Yes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do with taking likenesses?"
Keep your raptures for Harriet's face.," ""Exactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--I have not a doubt of your success."
"Harriet's features are very delicate, which makes a likeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch."""," ""But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit."
"As you will do it, it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession."""," ""Oh!"
"How completely it meant, 'why should my picture be drawn?'"""," Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others."
A likeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital.," Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and was repeating, ""No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as you observe."
"Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and was repeating,","with so interesting a consciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once."
"Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he ought, entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again."," The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction, took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the picture, which was rapid and happy."
"Every body who saw it was pleased, but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every criticism."," ""Do you think so?"""
"It is the fault of her face that she has them not."""," ""You have made her too tall, Emma,"" said Mr. Knightley."
"We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.""",said Mr. Knightley.
"Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly added,"," ""It is very pretty,"" said Mr. Woodhouse."
"Exactly so indeed!"""," ""But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer."
"The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she seems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her shoulders--and it makes one think she must catch cold."""," ""But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear."""
"Look at the tree."""," ""You, sir, may say any thing,"" cried Mr. Elton, ""but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out of doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit!"
"""But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.""", The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a few difficulties.
"Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough.","said he with a tender sigh, as he received it."
"And he wrote as if he really loved her very much--but she did not know--and so, she was come as fast as she could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she should do.--"" Emma was half-ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful."," ""Will you read the letter?"""
"He will connect himself well if he can.""", Emma was not sorry to be pressed.
"She paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion, with a","and was at last forced to add, ""Is it a good letter?"
"She paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion, with a ""Well, well,"" and was at last forced to add,"," ""Yes, indeed, a very good letter,"" replied Emma rather slowly--""so good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his sisters must have helped him."
"or is it too short?"""," ""Well,"" said the still waiting Harriet;--""well--and--and what shall I do?"""
"A better written letter, Harriet (returning it,) than I had expected."""," ""What shall you do!"
"""Well,"" said the still waiting Harriet;--""well--and--and what shall I do?"""," ""Yes."""
"Do you mean with regard to this letter?"""," ""But what are you in doubt of?"
"""Yes."""," ""Yes."
"You must answer it of course--and speedily."""," ""Oh no, no!"
"Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me."""," ""You think I ought to refuse him then,"" said Harriet, looking down."
"You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his disappointment.""","said Harriet, looking down."
"""You think I ought to refuse him then,"" said Harriet, looking down.", Harriet was silent.
"With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:"," ""No, I do not; that is, I do not mean--What shall I do?"
"With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:  ""You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect."""," ""I shall not give you any advice, Harriet."
"Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to do."""," ""I had no notion that he liked me so very much,"" said Harriet, contemplating the letter."
"This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.""","said Harriet, contemplating the letter."
"For a little while Emma persevered in her silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful, she thought it best to say,"," ""Oh!"
"But do not imagine that I want to influence you."""," ""Not for the world,"" said Emma, smiling graciously, ""would I advise you either way."
"no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you would just advise me what I had best do--No, no, I do not mean that--As you say, one's mind ought to be quite made up--One should not be hesitating--It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say 'No,' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say 'No?'"""," The symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned away confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was still in her hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without regard."
"At last, with some hesitation, Harriet said--"," ""Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just what you ought."
"Do you think I am right?"""," Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her forcibly."
"Harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her forcibly."," ""Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it must have been."
"That would have been too dreadful!--What an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world."""," ""Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it!"
"I must have given you up."""," ""Dear affectionate creature!--_You_ banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!--_You_ confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life!"
"It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more!"""," ""I do not think he is conceited either, in general,"" said Harriet, her conscience opposing such censure; ""at least, he is very good natured, and I shall always feel much obliged to him, and have a great regard for--but that is quite a different thing from--and you know, though he may like me, it does not follow that I should--and certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people--and if one comes to compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all, _one_ is so very handsome and agreeable."
"He must have a pretty good opinion of himself."""," ""Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend."
"However, I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him; and his being so much attached to me--and his writing such a letter--but as to leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration."""," ""Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too."""
"A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or because he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter."""," Emma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a ""very true; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that her husband could write a good letter."""

"She was rather low all the evening, but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton.",was said in rather a sorrowful tone.
"""I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,"" was said in rather a sorrowful tone."," ""And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy but at Hartfield."""
"You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey-Mill."""," Some time afterwards it was, ""I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much surprized if she knew what had happened."
"Some time afterwards it was,"," ""One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school, Harriet."
"I am sure Miss Nash would--for Miss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a linen-draper."""," Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that people should like her so much."
"The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly cheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards the rejected Mr. Martin."," ""Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed,"" cried Emma."
"I hope he will not mind it so very much."""," ""My picture!--But he has left my picture in Bond-street."""

"The preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of his children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least, which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his discontent."," Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the ""Very true, my love,"" which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion; but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all."

She heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his son; she heard the words,"repeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much suspected that he was announcing an early visit from his son; but before she could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her would have been awkward."

"Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith?--that you have never thought seriously of her?"""," ""Encouragement!--I give you encouragement!--Sir, you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it."
"I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!--No, madam, my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement I received--"""," He was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer, for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace."
"Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and she would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken--more in error--more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could the effects of her blunders have been confined to herself.", How she could have been so deceived!--He protested that he had never thought seriously of Harriet--never!
"She was quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more."," She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a more serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might be, and must be."
"It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir out; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep entirely from them,--"," These days of confinement would have been, but for her private perplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited her brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to his companions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his ill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during the rest of his stay at Hartfield."
"She then proceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the sight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement with Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was taking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making use of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself."," ""I do not know why you should say so."
"""The Churchills are very likely in fault,"" said Mr. Knightley, coolly; ""but I dare say he might come if he would."""," ""I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a point of it."
"He wishes exceedingly to come; but his uncle and aunt will not spare him."""," ""How odd you are!"
"It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof."""," ""I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting that he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very little for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who have always set him the example of it."
"What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you suppose him such an unnatural creature?"""," ""That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your own master."
"It is impossible."""," ""It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount."
"You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage."""," ""Yes, sometimes he can."""
"This proves that he can leave the Churchills."""," ""And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure."""
"""Yes, sometimes he can."""," ""It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an intimate knowledge of their situation."
"""And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure."""," ""There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and that is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and resolution."
"He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can at others."""," ""No,"" said Emma, laughing; ""but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again."
"--If he would say so to her at once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no opposition made to his going."""," ""Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it."
"Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for him!--Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as loud as he could!--How can you imagine such conduct practicable?"""," ""I rather doubt that."
"If he would act in this sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds would bend to his."""," ""Then it would not be so strong a sense."
"He may have as strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have, without being so equal, under particular circumstances, to act up to it."""," ""Oh, the difference of situation and habit!"
"If it failed to produce equal exertion, it could not be an equal conviction."""," ""Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first occasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others."
"I wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his life."""," ""We shall never agree about him,"" cried Emma; ""but that is nothing extraordinary."
"Had he begun as he ought, there would have been no difficulty now."""," ""Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it."
"I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some advantages, it will secure him many others."""," ""Your feelings are singular."
"His letters disgust me."""," ""I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston."
"They seem to satisfy every body else."""," ""You seem determined to think ill of him."""
"He may be very 'amiable,' have very good manners, and be very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people: nothing really amiable about him."""," ""Me!--not at all,"" replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; ""I do not want to think ill of him."
"""You seem determined to think ill of him."""," ""Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure at Highbury."
"I should be as ready to acknowledge his merits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely personal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth, plausible manners."""," ""You will excuse my being so much over-powered."
"There will be but one subject throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest--one object of curiosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speak of nobody else."""," ""My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of every body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable."
"If I find him conversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only a chattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts."""," ""And mine,"" said Mr. Knightley warmly, ""is, that if he turn out any thing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing!"
"To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music; and so on to every body, having that general information on all subjects which will enable him to follow the lead, or take the lead, just as propriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each; that is my idea of him."""," ""I will say no more about him,"" cried Emma, ""you turn every thing to evil."
"My dear Emma, your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point."""," ""Prejudiced!"
"We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have no chance of agreeing till he is really here."""," ""But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it."
"I am not prejudiced."""," ""He is a person I never think of from one month's end to another,"" said Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediately talk of something else, though she could not comprehend why he should be angry."
"My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour.""","said Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediately talk of something else, though she could not comprehend why he should be angry."
"She could not think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required more; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned;--but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded, and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter, and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive--",she found something else must be done.
"She had not been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he was actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she jumped away from him at last abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from her niece.","I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time for writing;' and when I immediately said, 'But indeed we have, we had a letter this very morning,' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized."
"And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, 'I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time for writing;'","ut indeed we have, we had a letter this very morning,' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized."
"And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, 'I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time for writing;' and when I immediately said, 'But indeed we have, we had a letter this very morning,'","Have you, upon your honour?'"
"'Have you, upon your honour?'","well, that is quite unexpected."
"Emma's politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest--"," ""Thank you."
"I hope she is well?""","I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do--and so much fine work as you have done too!--I only wish my eyes may last me as well.'"""
All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath; and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax's handwriting., And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it.
"She was pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very rude, of making her escape from Jane Fairfax's letter, and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when Miss Bates turned to her again and seized her attention."," ""Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?"""
"We never were so long without seeing her before, and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now."""," ""Oh yes; next week."""
"""Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?"""," ""Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure."""
"""Oh yes; next week."""," ""Thank you."
"""Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure."""," ""Yes, so I imagined."
"That is the reason of her writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in the common course, we should not have heard from her before next Tuesday or Wednesday."""," ""So obliging of you!"
"I was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day."""," At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma's brain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the not going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther discovery,  ""You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time."
"At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma's brain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the not going to Ireland, she said, with the insidious design of farther discovery,"," ""Very true, very true, indeed."
"Campbell."""," ""But, in spite of all her friends' urgency, and her own wish of seeing Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs."
"Dixon!"""," ""Yes--entirely her own doing, entirely her own choice; and Colonel and Mrs. Campbell think she does quite right, just what they should recommend; and indeed they particularly _wish_ her to try her native air, as she has not been quite so well as usual lately."""

"Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has no remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be compared with Miss Fairfax."""," ""Yes, that of course."""
"Miss Campbell always was absolutely plain--but extremely elegant and amiable."""," ""Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing!"
"""Yes, that of course."""," ""It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world."""
"Nobody could nurse her, as we should do."""," ""And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following--as you will find from Jane's letter."
"""It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.""",Bless me!
poor Jane is ill!," ""I am afraid we must be running away,"" said Emma, glancing at Harriet, and beginning to rise--""My father will be expecting us."
"Well, now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her.""", And not all that could be urged to detain her succeeded.
"Before she had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, than saying to Mr. Knightley,","Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state."
"He had been used to think her unjust to Jane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement."," ""I am happy you approved,"" said Emma, smiling; ""but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield."""
"I was glad you made her play so much, for having no instrument at her grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence."""," ""No, my dear,"" said her father instantly; ""_that_ I am sure you are not."
"""I am happy you approved,"" said Emma, smiling; ""but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield."""," ""No,"" said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; ""you are not often deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension."
"The muffin last night--if it had been handed round once, I think it would have been enough."""," An arch look expressed--""I understand you well enough;"" but she said only, ""Miss Fairfax is reserved."""
"An arch look expressed--""I understand you well enough;"" but she said only,"," ""I always told you she was--a little; but you will soon overcome all that part of her reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its foundation in diffidence."
"An arch look expressed--""I understand you well enough;"" but she said only, ""Miss Fairfax is reserved."""," ""You think her diffident."
"What arises from discretion must be honoured."""," ""My dear Emma,"" said he, moving from his chair into one close by her, ""you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant evening."""
"I do not see it."""," ""Oh!"

"no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; and amused to think how little information I obtained.""",was his only answer.

"She must have found the evening agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she had Emma."""," Emma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question--  ""She is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from."
"Emma saw his anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question--"," Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose thoughts were on the Bates's, said--  ""It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined!"
"Mr. Knightley looked as if he were more gratified than he cared to express; and before he could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose thoughts were on the Bates's, said--"," ""My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter."

"There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice, and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like."""," ""Emma,"" said Mr. Knightley presently, ""I have a piece of news for you."
"They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome."""," ""News!"
"You like news--and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you."""," He had time only to say,  ""No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,"" when the door was thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room."
"He had time only to say,","when the door was thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room."
"Mr. Knightley soon saw that he had lost his moment, and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him."," Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she was so completely surprized that she could not avoid a little start, and a little blush, at the sound."

"I say, sir,"" turning to Mr. Woodhouse,"," ""As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he has been acquainted with her,"" said Emma, ""nothing I suppose can be known."

"She exerted herself, and did try to make her comfortable, by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of being dwelt on,"," Harriet said, ""very true,"" and she ""would not think about it;"" but still she talked of it--still she could talk of nothing else; and Emma, at last, in order to put the Martins out of her head, was obliged to hurry on the news, which she had meant to give with so much tender caution; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet--such a conclusion of Mr. Elton's importance with her!"

"It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that neither ""master nor mistress was at home;"" they had both been out some time; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.","And she leaned back in the corner, to indulge her murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both--such being the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind."
"There was instant pleasure in the sight of them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr. Weston immediately accosted her with,"," There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife, fewer and quieter, but not less to the purpose."
"Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command, as well as the route and the method of his journey; and she listened, and smiled, and congratulated.","said he, at the conclusion."

"One cannot love a reserved person."""," He perfectly agreed with her: and after walking together so long, and thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him, that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting."
"His father only called him a coxcomb, and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it, was clear enough, by her passing it over as quickly as possible, and making no other comment than that"," With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him."
"As Mrs. Weston observed,"," There was one person among his new acquaintance in Surry, not so leniently disposed."
"The circumstance was told him at Hartfield; for the moment, he was silent; but Emma heard him almost immediately afterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he held in his hand,","She had half a mind to resent; but an instant's observation convinced her that it was really said only to relieve his own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she let it pass."
"Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation, and none had come for her father and herself; and Mrs. Weston's accounting for it with",was not quite sufficient.
"It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her first remark, on reading it, was that","she so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her to do, that their advice for her going was most prompt and successful."

"""The sooner every party breaks up, the better."""," ""No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to you for reminding me."
"You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have been your neighbours these _ten_ years."""," ""Oh yes, papa."
"You will be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends."""," He did, on the condition of some promises on her side: such as that, if she came home cold, she would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if hungry, that she would take something to eat; that her own maid should sit up for her; and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house, as usual."
"He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after seeing him, Emma thus moralised to herself:--"," With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him again, and for a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his general manners, and by inference, of the meaning of his manners towards herself; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her to throw coldness into her air; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be, who were now seeing them together for the first time."
"She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart, for he stopped to hand her out."," He thanked her, observing, ""How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment!"
"He thanked her, observing,"," ""Yes I should, I am sure I should."

"Mrs. Cole was telling that she had been calling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte--a very elegant looking instrument--not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the substance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her side, and explanations on Miss Bates's, was, that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood's the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece--entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates's account, Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it--but now, they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter;--of course it must be from Colonel Campbell."," Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her; every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell, and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way, and still listen to Mrs. Cole."

"I am sure he was particularly silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner."""," They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend; for Mrs. Weston was the most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;--and at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it."
"As a sort of touchstone, however, she began to speak of his kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short, she believed it to indicate only his disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his own."," ""Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,"" he replied;--""but you must often wish it, I am sure."""

"Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to, pursued only by the sounds of her desultory good-will.","   CHAPTER X   The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was tranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her usual employment, slumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near her, most deedily occupied about her spectacles, and Jane Fairfax, standing with her back to them, intent on her pianoforte."
"Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again."," ""What!"""
"You find me trying to be useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed."""," ""I have not been working uninterruptedly,"" he replied, ""I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her instrument stand steadily, it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe."
"you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate."""," He contrived that she should be seated by him; and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her, and trying to make her help or advise him in his work, till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again."
"Mrs. Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.", Jane did not look round.
Mrs. Weston had been speaking to her at the same moment.," He shook his head with a smile, and looked as if he had very little doubt and very little mercy."
"Soon afterwards he began again,", He paused.

"It must be all conjecture.""","to Mrs. Bates,) of restoring your spectacles, healed for the present."""

She played.," She looked up at him for a moment, coloured deeply, and played something else."
"He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte, and turning to Emma, said,"," Emma wished he would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused; and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains of a smile, when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight, she had less scruple in the amusement, and much less compunction with respect to her.--This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings."
"He brought all the music to her, and they looked it over together.--Emma took the opportunity of whispering,"," ""I hope she does."
"She must understand you."""," ""But really, I am half ashamed, and wish I had never taken up the idea."""
"I am not in the least ashamed of my meaning."""," ""I am very glad you did, and that you communicated it to me."

"So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his turn, for most resolutely and commandingly did he say,", And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he would hear her in any thing else.

'Can I do any thing for you at Kingston?'," Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates, before they set off for Randalls."
"Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance; and the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly who there would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple.",had been repeated many times over.
"""You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five,"" had been repeated many times over."," But soon it came to be on one side,  ""But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think there will."""
"It made him so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be persevered in.",speaking lower) is very thoughtless.
That young man (speaking lower), Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge.
"Every door was now closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on Frank Churchill's part, that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten.", Emma demurred.
Emma demurred.," ""Very true,"" he gravely replied; ""it was very bad."""
"""It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in?""","But still he went on measuring, and still he ended with,  ""I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple."""
"But still he went on measuring, and still he ended with,"," ""No, no,"" said she, ""you are quite unreasonable."
"But still he went on measuring, and still he ended with,  ""I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple."""," ""There is no denying it,"" he replied."
"Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!"""," Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self-willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest."
It soon appeared that he came to announce an improvement.," ""The Crown!"""
"May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the Crown Inn?"""," ""Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot, my father hopes his friends will be so kind as to visit him there."
"""The Crown!"""," ""It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs. Weston do not."
"Is not it a good exchange?--You consent--I hope you consent?"""," She was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully comprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable."
"They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere."""," ""Sir,"" said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, ""you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character."
"Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but nobody else could."""," ""From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir."
"But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father's house."""," ""Open the windows!--but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls."
"We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief."""," ""Ah!"
"Dancing with open windows!--I am sure, neither your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would suffer it."""," ""Have you indeed, sir?--Bless me!"
"I have often known it done myself."""," ""But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--""  ""Oh!"""
"If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what can be done."""," ""Oh!"""
"""But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited--"""," ""So they will, my dear."
"They will be so near their own stable."""," ""I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be under Mrs. Weston's care."

"Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole.""","If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.'"
"'If _Miss_ _Taylor_ undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.'"," ""Aye, very true."
"How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her!"""," ""My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,"" said Frank Churchill, ""examining the capabilities of the house."
"I hope whenever poor Isabella's little ones have the measles, she will send for Perry."""," Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father, engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown."
"There were Mr. and Mrs. Weston; delighted to see her and receive her approbation, very busy and very happy in their different way; she, in some little distress; and he, finding every thing perfect."," ""My dear, you are too particular,"" said her husband."
"in places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined."""," The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, ""Men never know when things are dirty or not;"" and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself, ""Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares."""
"She then took another line of expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,"," And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through the passage, was calling out,  ""You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear."
"And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through the passage, was calling out,"," ""I wish,"" said Mrs. Weston, ""one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best."
"It is a mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs."""," ""Yes, very true,"" cried Frank, ""very true."
"To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object--if one could but tell what that would be."""," ""Well--if you please,"" said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, ""if you think she will be of any use."""
"Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?"""," ""You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,"" said Emma."
"""Well--if you please,"" said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, ""if you think she will be of any use."""," ""But she is so amusing, so extremely amusing!"
"I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates."""," Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it his decided approbation."

"The party did not break up without Emma's being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor without her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife,","   CHAPTER XII   One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to Emma--its being fixed for a day within the granted term of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston's confidence, she could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his fortnight."
"To her voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply, than,", This Emma felt was aimed at her; and it made her quite angry.
It made her animated--open hearted--she voluntarily said;--, It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he would have preferred the society of William Larkins.

Emma looked graciously.," ""As you do us such ample justice now,"" said Emma, laughing, ""I will venture to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?"

"It was better to pay my visit, then""--  He hesitated, got up, walked to a window.","-  He looked at her, as if wanting to read her thoughts."
"Forcing herself to speak, therefore, in the hope of putting it by, she calmly said,",-  He was silent.
"A few awkward moments passed, and he sat down again; and in a more determined manner said,","-  He stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.--He was more in love with her than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might have ended, if his father had not made his appearance?"

"What strength, or what constancy of affection he might be subject to, was another point; but at present she could not doubt his having a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all the rest, made her think that she _must_ be a little in love with him, in spite of every previous determination against it."," Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness."
"He could not say that he was sorry on his own account; his very cheerful look would have contradicted him if he had; but he said, and very steadily, that he was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with considerable kindness added,"," It was some days before she saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her honest regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her composure was odious."
"When she became sensible of this, it struck her that she could not be very much in love; for in spite of her previous and fixed determination never to quit her father, never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she could foresee in her own feelings."," Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings."
"Upon the whole, she was equally contented with her view of his feelings."," When his letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and she read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her at first shake her head over her own sensations, and think she had undervalued their strength."
"Was it impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his inferior in understanding; but he had been very much struck with the loveliness of her face and the warm simplicity of her manner; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her favour.--For Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed."," It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf, though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that quarter was at hand."
At last Emma attacked her on another ground., Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation.
"Emma continued,", This appeal to her affections did more than all the rest.
"The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she really loved extremely, made her wretched for a while, and when the violence of grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her in it very tolerably."," Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well, nor valued her affection so highly before."
"Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do, made Emma feel that she had never loved Harriet so well, nor valued her affection so highly before.","   CHAPTER XIV   Mrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to settle whether she were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or not pretty at all."
"The visit was of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one, beyond the nothing-meaning terms of being", She did not really like her.
"The woman was better off; she might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his own good sense to depend on; and when she considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he had just married, the woman he had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he had been expected to marry, she must allow him to have the right to look as little wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as could be.", There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.
There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer.," ""I think her beautiful, quite beautiful."""
"yes--very--a very pleasing young woman."""," ""Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown."""

"""Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown."""," ""Oh!"
"""I am not at all surprized that he should have fallen in love."""," ""I dare say,"" returned Harriet, sighing again, ""I dare say she was very much attached to him."""
"no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune; and she came in his way."""," ""Perhaps she might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the woman who loves him best."
"""I dare say,"" returned Harriet, sighing again, ""I dare say she was very much attached to him."""," ""Yes,"" said Harriet earnestly, ""and well she might, nobody could ever have a better."
"Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought this the best offer she was likely to have."""," When the visit was returned, Emma made up her mind."
"The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove,",-a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove.
"Elton was appealed to.--""Was not it astonishingly like?--She could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove.""",with a little sigh of sentiment).

"Emma made as slight a reply as she could; but it was fully sufficient for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.", Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment.
"She had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to attack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply,"," ""Oh!"
"Surry is full of beauties."""," ""Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction."
"Surry is the garden of England."""," ""No, I fancy not,"" replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile."
"Many counties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as Surry.""", Emma was silenced.
Emma was silenced.," ""No; not immediately here."
"You have many parties of that kind here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?"""," ""Ah!"
"We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and we are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure.""",I really cannot get this girl to move from the house.

"And then, to prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly."," ""Oh!"

"Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration--but without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she must be wanting to assist and befriend her.--Before Emma had forfeited her confidence, and about the third time of their meeting, she heard all Mrs. Elton's knight-errantry on the subject.--","        'Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,           'And waste its fragrance on the desert air.'"

He had said that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her., Every invitation was successful.
"It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he said,"," ""I went only to the post-office,"" said she, ""and reached home before the rain was much."

"Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very positive curse."""," ""I have often thought them the worst of the two,"" replied he coolly."
"""You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of friendship."""," ""Ah!"
"""Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does."""," ""When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,""  said John Knightley, ""I meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings."
"You have every body dearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shall again; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections, a post-office, I think, must always have power to draw me out, in worse weather than to-day."""," It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence."
"Her attention was now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his custom on such occasions, making the circle of his guests, and paying his particular compliments to the ladies, was ending with her--and with all his mildest urbanity, said,"," ""Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me."""

"If Jane repressed her for a little time, she soon began again; and though much that passed between them was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side, there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects: The post-office--catching cold--fetching letters--and friendship, were long under discussion; and to them succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane--inquiries whether she had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her, and professions of Mrs. Elton's meditated activity."," ""But I have never fixed on June or any other month--merely looked forward to the summer in general."""

"A situation such as you deserve, and your friends would require for you, is no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moment's notice; indeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring directly."""," ""Oh!"
"There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce something--Offices for the sale--not quite of human flesh--but of human intellect."""," ""I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,"" replied Jane; ""governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies."
"You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition."""," ""Something that would do!"""

"Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in the family as much as you chose;--that is--I do not know--if you knew the harp, you might do all that, I am very sure; but you sing as well as play;--yes, I really believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate for what you chose;--and you must and shall be delightfully, honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest."""," ""And I am quite serious too, I assure you,"" replied Mrs. Elton gaily, ""in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends to watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us."""

"He gave her a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; he had met with it in his way, and had taken the liberty of opening it."," The two ladies looked over it together; and he sat smiling and talking to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible to every body."

"Enscombe is in Yorkshire?"""," ""Yes, upon my word, very considerable."
"""Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London, a considerable journey."""," ""The evil of the distance from Enscombe,"" said Mr. Weston, ""is, that Mrs. Churchill, _as_ _we_ _understand_, has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together."

Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed., The mistake had been slight.
In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--,and away he went.
"Mr. Weston was following; but Mrs. Elton detained him, to gratify him by her opinion of his son; and so briskly did she begin, that the young man himself, though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing."," While she talked of his son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained; but when she got to Maple Grove, he could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away."
Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston.," Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her duty as Mrs. Weston's to receive them."
"As the door opened she was heard,"," Frank Churchill returned to his station by Emma; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet, she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little way behind her.--He was thoughtful."
"After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself--and it was,","-with many other relative questions, all answered with patient politeness."
"Mrs. Elton then said,"," At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises, and did not want to hear more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till another suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctly forward.--Mr."
"Elton had just joined them, and his wife was exclaiming,"," ""Jane!"""

Then changing from a frown to a smile--, Emma could hardly understand him; he seemed in an odd humour.
It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she would expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude.," Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting _him_ to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon.--Mr."
"When she was half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that his wife, who was standing immediately above her, was not only listening also, but even encouraging him by significant glances.--The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say,","to which his prompt reply was, ""Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me."""

He was warm in his reprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness; and Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due share of censure.," He looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added, ""_She_ ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he may be.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma, that you did want him to marry Harriet."""

"""Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.--If one leads you wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it."""," ""And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the justice to say, that you would have chosen for him better than he has chosen for himself.--Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which Mrs. Elton is totally without."

"said he, offering his hand."," ""Brother and sister!"
"You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.""", CHAPTER III   This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure.
"CHAPTER IV   A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her hand, and after sitting down and hesitating, thus began:", Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her to speak.
"There was a seriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her, quite as much as her words, for something more than ordinary."," ""Yes,"" said Emma, ""I hope I do."""
"I do not want to say more than is necessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and I dare say you understand me."""," ""How I could so long a time be fancying myself!..."""
"""Yes,"" said Emma, ""I hope I do.""","cried Harriet, warmly."
"cried Harriet, warmly.","said she, with a conscious look."
"said she, with a conscious look."," ""No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued very much."""
"""Not the least in the world.--Did he ever give you any thing?"""," She held the parcel towards her, and Emma read the words _Most_ _precious_ _treasures_ on the top."
"Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box, which Harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but, excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister."," ""No, indeed I do not."""
"""Now,"" said Harriet, ""you _must_ recollect."""," ""Dear me!"
"""No, indeed I do not."""," ""My dearest Harriet!"""
"And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making a treasure of it--so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now and then as a great treat."""," ""And had you really some at hand yourself?"
"my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in my pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life.--Well--(sitting down again)--go on--what else?"""," ""And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his sake!"""
"I am sure I never suspected it, you did it so naturally."""," said Emma, recovering from her state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement."
"And secretly she added to herself,"," ""Here,"" resumed Harriet, turning to her box again, ""here is something still more valuable, I mean that _has_ _been_ more valuable, because this is what did really once belong to him, which the court-plaister never did."""
"I never was equal to this.""", Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure.
"It was the end of an old pencil,--the part without any lead."," ""I do remember it,"" cried Emma; ""I perfectly remember it.--Talking about spruce-beer.--Oh!"
"But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment."""," ""Ah!"
"I have an idea he was standing just here.""","-  ""Well, go on."""
--," ""Oh!"
"--  ""Well, go on."""," ""My poor dear Harriet!"
"I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to see me do it."""," ""Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them."
"and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things?"""," ""But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be useful."""
"I knew it was--but had not resolution enough to part with them."""," ""I shall be happier to burn it,"" replied Harriet."
"""But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be useful."""," ""And when,"" thought Emma, ""will there be a beginning of Mr."
"Elton."""," She had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she had _told_ no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a fortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and quite undesignedly."
"She merely said, in the course of some trivial chat, ""Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so""--and thought no more of it, till after a minute's silence she heard Harriet say in a very serious tone,"," Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a moment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,  ""Never marry!--This is a new resolution."""

"After another short hesitation,"," ""Mr. Elton indeed!"""
"Elton?""", She then took a longer time for consideration.
"She had previously determined how far she would proceed, on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have the judicious law of her own brain laid down with speed.--She was decided, and thus spoke--"," ""Oh!"
"Is not it so?"""," ""I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet."
"Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose-- Indeed I am not so mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him at a distance--and to think of his infinite superiority to all the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so proper, in me especially."""," ""Service!"
"The service he rendered you was enough to warm your heart."""," ""It is very natural."
"From perfect misery to perfect happiness!""", Harriet kissed her hand in silent and submissive gratitude.
The gentlemen spoke of his horse.," Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, ""I did not know that he ever had any such plan."""
"Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said,"," ""Nay, I had it from you."
"Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, ""I did not know that he ever had any such plan."""," ""Me!"

"You will not be sorry to find yourself at home."""," ""No, sir,"" replied his son, laughing, ""I seem to have had it from nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's having mentioned it in one of her letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with all these particulars--but as she declares she never heard a syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream."
"You had it from himself, had you?"""," ""It is odd though,"" observed his father, ""that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe."
"Perry.""", Emma was out of hearing.
"She had hurried on before her guests to prepare her father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of Mr. Weston's hint.", They were entering the hall.
"Tea passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move."," Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves."
"He saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly entertaining, though it was something which she judged it proper to appear to censure; for she said,","He heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane, ""I will give it to her--shall I?"""
"He heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane,",-and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth.
--and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth., It was done however.
"She was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed more deeply than he had ever perceived her, and saying only,","pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered."
"Her face was averted from those who had made the attack, and turned towards her aunt."," Jane's alertness in moving, proved her as ready as her aunt had preconceived."
It was his duty., Emma was extremely confused.
"She could not endure to give him the true explanation; for though her suspicions were by no means removed, she was really ashamed of having ever imparted them."," ""The joke,"" he replied gravely, ""seemed confined to you and Mr."
"she cried in evident embarrassment, ""it all meant nothing; a mere joke among ourselves."""," He had hoped she would speak again, but she did not."
"He owed it to her, to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference, rather than her welfare; to encounter any thing, rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause."," ""Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax?"
"""My dear Emma,"" said he at last, with earnest kindness, ""do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?"""," ""Have you never at any time had reason to think that he admired her, or that she admired him?"""
"yes, perfectly.--Why do you make a doubt of it?"""," ""Never, never!"""

"""I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them--certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be public."""," She spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction which silenced, Mr. Knightley."
Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of her outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper.," Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private."
Mrs. Elton's resources were inadequate to such an attack.," ""You had better explore to Donwell,"" replied Mr. Knightley."
"Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston."""," If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he was obliged to proceed so, for his proposal was caught at with delight; and the ""Oh!"

"I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible.""", Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade.
"These were pleasant feelings, and she walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the strawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton, in all her apparatus of happiness, her large bonnet and her basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or talking--strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or spoken of.--"," Such, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only once by Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her solicitude after her son-in-law, to inquire if he were come--and she was a little uneasy.--She had some fears of his horse."
"Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him, and now he would shew them all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child, than in a total want of taste for what he saw, for he was slow, constant, and methodical.--Before this second looking over was begun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments' free observation of the entrance and ground-plot of the house--and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly in from the garden, and with a look of escape.--Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she was in quest of."," ""Certainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone?"""
"Till they all come in I shall not be missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I am gone?"""," ""Yes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast."
"""Certainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone?"""," ""But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone."

"It can be round in five minutes."""," She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, ""That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now."
"She spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied,"," ""I am,""--she answered--""I am fatigued; but it is not the sort of fatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse, we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits."
"The heat even would be danger.--You are fatigued already.""", Emma had not another word to oppose.
"Her parting look was grateful--and her parting words,","-seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her, even towards some of those who loved her best."
"--seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her, even towards some of those who loved her best."," Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only accomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when Frank Churchill entered the room."
"The heat was excessive; he had never suffered any thing like it--almost wished he had staid at home--nothing killed him like heat--he could bear any degree of cold, etc., but heat was intolerable--and he sat down, at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse's fire, looking very deplorable.",said Emma.
"""You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,"" said Emma."," Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill's state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour."
"Emma returned all her attention to her father, saying in secret--"," He was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came back all the better--grown quite cool--and, with good manners, like himself--able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest in their employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he should be so late."
They were looking over views in Swisserland.," ""That may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland."
"I shall do something to expose myself."""," ""They may be induced to go too."

"I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy--I am sick of England--and would leave it to-morrow, if I could."""," ""_I_ sick of prosperity and indulgence!"
"Cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?"""," ""You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came."

"Frank Churchill's little inclination to exclude himself increased so much, that his last words to Emma were,", She smiled her acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from Richmond was to take him back before the following evening.
She still intended him for her friend.," ""Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that you were too late for the best strawberries."

"She made her plan; she would speak of something totally different--the children in Brunswick Square; and she only waited for breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her, by saying,"," ""Oh!"
"Emma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the next moment."""," ""Thank you,"" said he, in an accent of deep mortification, and not another syllable followed."
"""Take a little time, consider, do not commit yourself.""",said he.

"The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most prominent feeling."," While he spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful velocity of thought, had been able--and yet without losing a word--to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that Harriet's hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as complete a delusion as any of her own--that Harriet was nothing; that she was every thing herself; that what she had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her own feelings; and that her agitation, her doubts, her reluctance, her discouragement, had been all received as discouragement from herself.--And not only was there time for these convictions, with all their glow of attendant happiness; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet's secret had not escaped her, and to resolve that it need not, and should not.--It was all the service she could now render her poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her to entreat him to transfer his affection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the two--or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him at once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he could not marry them both, Emma had it not."
"She was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing it to be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen so much to blame in his conduct.", But that would not do.
"Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she must return it by him."," He began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, ""Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his mother-in-law a few months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference."""
